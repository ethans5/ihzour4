It would be nice to see a bit more of a consistent approach and more truth about Labour ’ s positions . We will defend this country , we will defend our armed forces and we will work to support our veterans as we rightly should , particularly as we are coming up to Remembrance Sunday this weekend . I normally talk from the Opposition Front Bench on international issues , but I want to reflect as a constituency MP on some of the challenges facing the world at the moment . That is important in a constituency such as mine , because of its nature as a port and having had people come from all over the world for over 150 years . What happens elsewhere in the world — in Israel and Palestine , Afghanistan , Sudan , Libya , the Sahel , south Asia , Yemen , Nigeria , Syria and many , many other regions and countries — matters deeply to my constituents . In the past weeks I have heard from constituents about their anguish at the deaths , loss of civilian life and destruction in Gaza , and their horror at the terrorism , hostage taking and killing that Israel and its citizens have had to endure . I have heard about the need to ensure we protect civilians , aid workers , hospitals and schools ; to secure humanitarian pauses and get humanitarian aid in , particularly into Gaza ; and to move back to a pathway to peace and a two - state solution , and to an adherence to international law and international humanitarian law . I have also , with other hon . Members and neighbours in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan , heard face to face from those who have families who are directly affected in both Gaza and Israel — a genuine fear about what divisions can mean for us in our communities . I am also proud of the resilience and response from communities in Cardiff South and Penarth , whether in raising funds for aid and relief efforts in many different situations around the world , including in the middle east at the moment , or in working to promote inter - faith and inter - cultural dialogue here in the UK . That is absolutely critical when we are faced with a shocking rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia , and a wider rise in race and religious hate crime . I want to conclude by saying that this weekend I saw communities in my area at their very best . I joined Indian — Hindu , Sikh and others — communities celebrating Diwali together . I joined a very diverse group of Christian and other faith communities who were celebrating with the Greek Orthodox Church 150 years of the Greek and Greek - Cypriot communities in Cardiff South and Penarth . I also met young Muslims and others with Citizens Wales to discuss their hopes and aspirations for the future . We need more dialogue in this country and less division . I would hope that that would be the heart of any Government ’ s programme . I know it would be the heart of a Labour Government ’ s programme . I have to acquaint the House that this House has this dayattended His Majesty in the House of Peers , and that His Majesty was pleased to make a Most Gracious Speech from the Throne to both Houses of Parliament , of which I have , for greater accuracy , obtained a copy .

Following this urgent question , we undertake to contact the Red Cross , one of our partner organisations , with the message that this House wants that aid to re - enter the area , and to save lives . The powerful scenes of Palestinians celebrating the start of Ramadan , even as their homes and lives have been reduced to rubble by Israeli forces , send a defiant message to the world that despite the displacement and destruction , Palestinians remain rooted in their land . Will the Minister confirm that the decision to block all aid to Gaza , collectively punishing the entire population , is a war crime and a breach of international law , contravening provisions of the Geneva convention and the Rome statute ? My hon . Friend is quite right to point out the devastating impact of no aid getting through , and to say that a halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza , such as that recently announced by the Government of Israel , risks breaching Israel ’ s obligations under international humanitarian law . It is not for Ministers at the Dispatch Box to make legal decisions or judgments , but I assure my hon . Friend that the former Minister for development pledged £17 million to ensure that healthcare , food and shelter can reach tens of thousands of civilians , and to support vital infrastructure . My hon . Friend must reassure her constituents that the Foreign Office is doing all it can to get infrastructure across the OPTs and into Gaza , in order to relieve the suffering . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . The Israeli Government are wrong to prevent humanitarian aid entering Gaza . That threatens the lives of Gazans who are dependent on aid after the destruction of the past 15 months , and is a clear breach of international humanitarian law . What practical steps are the Government taking to ensure that the Israeli Government back down and let that aid in ? I understand the depth of distress in Israel about the despicable way that Hamas terrorists have played psychological games with the hostages and their families , but withholding essential supplies of food , medicine and shelter only worsens the devastation faced by the Palestinian people . In the west bank , we also see illegal settlers violently attacking Palestinians and apparently receiving the support of members of the Israeli Cabinet . Does the Minister agree that we in the UK must do all we can to undermine the extremists in this conflict , so that a second phase of the ceasefire can be negotiated , all hostages can be released , and Gazans can receive the aid that they desperately need ? I thank the Lib Dem spokesperson for his words . He is quite right to emphasise the psychological impact of this terrible conflict , and the traumatised state of people in the region . As the Foreign Secretary has said , we welcome the release of the 38 hostages in Gaza , including of course Emily Damari , whom we have already mentioned . We think so much of those members of the Lifshitz family — they of course had strong ties to the UK — who were held hostage by terrorists in Gaza and who died . We thank Qatar , Egypt and the US for providing support to ensure that the horrific ordeal of individuals and families can come to an end , but unfortunately , this is not the end .

His account echoed an October New York Times report , which cited 44 doctors , nurses and paramedics who witnessed numerous cases of pre - pubescent children being shot in the head or chest during the ongoing conflict in Gaza . What steps are the Government taking to prevent a genocide in Gaza ? We have heard a number of deeply concerning reports about developments in Gaza . I know that has also been the case for the Select Committee , as my hon . Friend mentioned . The UK Government ’ s position could not be clearer : international law , including international humanitarian law , must be held to , and that covers in particular the operations of healthcare workers . We pay tribute to them operating in such difficult circumstances . As we have been hearing , the situation in Gaza — especially northern Gaza — is dire , with the UN anticipating that this year up to 60 , 000 children under the age of five could be facing acute malnutrition . At the same time , the trucks entering Gaza have reduced by 63 % since October 2023 . I welcome the leading role that the Government are taking in providing vital humanitarian aid for Gaza , but does the Minister agree that the ongoing Israeli restrictions on the flow of essential aid are completely unacceptable and should be lifted immediately ? Yes . We are seeing a disturbing impact from those restrictions ; we have seen it in the famine assessment and in the levels of malnutrition and ill health now prevalent in Gaza . Winter is now upon us , making the situation even worse . The restrictions on aid are unacceptable . They must be lifted immediately . When the Foreign Secretary was in Baku recently for COP29 , did he discuss with his interlocutors across the region the extent to which the global finance goals would impact on humanitarian assistance in the middle east ? Yes , the Foreign Secretary did discuss those matters , including directly with Mia Mottley , the Premier of Barbados , who has been leading many of the small island developing states on these issues . Certainly , the UK is determined to play its part on humanitarian issues as well as globally on climate issues . That is so important for our own country as well as for the rest of the world . Some weeks ago , I asked the Foreign Secretary about getting assurances that children receiving polio vaccinations would not be killed after receiving them . Since then , thousands of children have been killed in northern Gaza . Given the ICC ’ s recent ruling about war crimes , the British public no doubt want to know why the Government are shying away from their legal and moral obligation to ban all arms and all trade . The UK Government have been determined to use every mechanism to advance international humanitarian law . That includes within the UN Security Council , as we just discussed , but we have also been taking action at every bilateral and multilateral opportunity , including on polio , where the UK led efforts to get vaccination going in the first place .

The UK Government have been a supporter of the work of UNRWA throughout this conflict and before it . We have been supporting UNRWA financially , as have all international organisations and countries . There have been problems with certain challenges to individuals who have been employed by UNRWA , but we have consistently joined with allies in expressing our concerns about the role of UNRWA being curtailed . At the UN Security Council sessions on 6 November , 11 December , 3 January , 28 January and 25 February , and in a joint statement with partners on 27 October , we urged that the important work of UNRWA can continue . The blockade of aid is just the last line in a long list of activities that Israelis have committed against the Palestinian people . Now that we have cut our overseas aid to a mere 0 . 3 % of GDP — the lowest in real terms in 20 years — does the Minister still agree with the Labour party manifesto that international aid makes the world “ a safer , more prosperous place ” ? Does she agree that , with this move , the UK ’ s historic role in the middle east is dead and over ? The hon . Member is right to talk about the ongoing need for aid in the region , and the Prime Minister was very careful in his speech at the end of last week — I think he has mentioned it since then in the press — to say that humanitarian aid must continue . Gaza was specifically mentioned , because it is one of our top priorities . The hon . Member is aware that the decision to divert some of our aid spending into the defence of Europe is only a week old , but he must also be aware that we will come forward with the detail of that . I reassure him and his constituents that Gaza was specifically mentioned in this House by the Prime Minister , because it remains one of our top priorities in the Foreign Office . It is clear that Israel has been emboldened by Trumpian tactics in imposing a total siege and blocking all supplies , including humanitarian aid into Gaza , to force new ceasefire terms . We in this House should be clear and call that what it is : collective punishment of the Palestinian people , starvation as a method of war , and a blatant war crime . Will the Minister finally sanction Israel for these gross violations of international law ? Specifically on the question of sanctions , I think my hon . Friend knows what I am going to say , which is that we do not talk about them until we make a decision . We review any tools that we have available to us to protest . We also need to understand that we are in the midst of a peace process . We know that peace processes throughout history have had stop - start elements . What we are doing is making clear our views — the views of this House and of the Government — that humanitarian aid must not be prevented from entering Gaza . While this important peace process is going on , people still need to eat . They still need lifesaving medical treatment . Children still need to be educated . That is the point we have continued to make all the way along .

I can assure him that exports of F - 35 components directly to Israel are already suspended where they are for use by Israel and not for re - export to other countries . Our strategic export licensing criteria state specifically that licences should not be granted where there is “ a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law . ” Given that the courts have sent this question back to Parliament , does the Minister accept that Israel is committing breaches of international humanitarian law ; does he accept that the export of F - 35 components is aiding in the commission of these wrongful acts ; and if he maintains that we are not in breach of our own arms export laws , will he explain on the Floor of this House the basis for how he thinks we are compliant with our own laws ? The F - 35 programme is the largest international collaborative defence programme in the world . The hon . Gentleman refers to the recent High Court judgment , and as the High Court itself noted , the UK cannot make changes to the F - 35 programme unilaterally — that requires agreement across all the partner nations and the availability of a workable programme - level change to isolate end users across thousands of different components . What assessment he has made of the potential impact of the industrial strategy on Teesside . My hon . Friend ’ s area is one of the most exciting investment locations in the world — in clean energy opportunities , carbon capture and storage , and offshore wind , but also in creative and digital investment , chemicals production and steel . Specific interventions for the Tees Valley include recommitting £160 million for its investment zone , enhanced support for the Teesside freeport for clean energy industries , and a lot of money for transport for city regions funding . Of particular interest to businesses in his area will be the new British industrial competitiveness scheme , which will reduce electricity costs by £35 to £40 per megawatt - hour for many businesses in Teesside . I am pleased that the Government have been listening to us and backing Teesside businesses with serious investment — I have been pushing for investment in clean power and advanced manufacturing . Last year , the 2024 UK tech jobs report named Middlesbrough as the UK ’ s fastest - growing tech destination . Will Ministers work with me to bring in investment in frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence to our region as well ? My hon . Friend and his colleagues are incredible champions for bringing investment into the area , and I recognise and thank him for that support . He is right to say that some of the perhaps more traditional industries , though very exciting for the future , are not just the only story in his area . He has mentioned tech and the creative industries too , and I would say they are huge opportunities . Specifically , our investment in skills to make sure that there is a pipeline of talent in every part of the country is a formidable and significant contribution to delivering on those opportunities . I look forward to continuing to work with him on these issues . What recent steps he has taken to support postmasters seeking redress for harm caused by faulty IT systems . By the end of last month , approximately £1 . 1 billion had been paid in total redress to almost 8 , 000 claimants .

It would be nice to see a bit more of a consistent approach and more truth about Labour ’ s positions . We will defend this country , we will defend our armed forces and we will work to support our veterans as we rightly should , particularly as we are coming up to Remembrance Sunday this weekend . I normally talk from the Opposition Front Bench on international issues , but I want to reflect as a constituency MP on some of the challenges facing the world at the moment . That is important in a constituency such as mine , because of its nature as a port and having had people come from all over the world for over 150 years . What happens elsewhere in the world — in Israel and Palestine , Afghanistan , Sudan , Libya , the Sahel , south Asia , Yemen , Nigeria , Syria and many , many other regions and countries — matters deeply to my constituents . In the past weeks I have heard from constituents about their anguish at the deaths , loss of civilian life and destruction in Gaza , and their horror at the terrorism , hostage taking and killing that Israel and its citizens have had to endure . I have heard about the need to ensure we protect civilians , aid workers , hospitals and schools ; to secure humanitarian pauses and get humanitarian aid in , particularly into Gaza ; and to move back to a pathway to peace and a two - state solution , and to an adherence to international law and international humanitarian law . I have also , with other hon . Members and neighbours in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan , heard face to face from those who have families who are directly affected in both Gaza and Israel — a genuine fear about what divisions can mean for us in our communities . I am also proud of the resilience and response from communities in Cardiff South and Penarth , whether in raising funds for aid and relief efforts in many different situations around the world , including in the middle east at the moment , or in working to promote inter - faith and inter - cultural dialogue here in the UK . That is absolutely critical when we are faced with a shocking rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia , and a wider rise in race and religious hate crime . I want to conclude by saying that this weekend I saw communities in my area at their very best . I joined Indian — Hindu , Sikh and others — communities celebrating Diwali together . I joined a very diverse group of Christian and other faith communities who were celebrating with the Greek Orthodox Church 150 years of the Greek and Greek - Cypriot communities in Cardiff South and Penarth . I also met young Muslims and others with Citizens Wales to discuss their hopes and aspirations for the future . We need more dialogue in this country and less division . I would hope that that would be the heart of any Government ’ s programme . I know it would be the heart of a Labour Government ’ s programme . I have to acquaint the House that this House has this dayattended His Majesty in the House of Peers , and that His Majesty was pleased to make a Most Gracious Speech from the Throne to both Houses of Parliament , of which I have , for greater accuracy , obtained a copy .

The powerful scenes of Palestinians celebrating the start of Ramadan , even as their homes and lives have been reduced to rubble by Israeli forces , send a defiant message to the world that despite the displacement and destruction , Palestinians remain rooted in their land . Will the Minister confirm that the decision to block all aid to Gaza , collectively punishing the entire population , is a war crime and a breach of international law , contravening provisions of the Geneva convention and the Rome statute ? My hon . Friend is quite right to point out the devastating impact of no aid getting through , and to say that a halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza , such as that recently announced by the Government of Israel , risks breaching Israel ’ s obligations under international humanitarian law . It is not for Ministers at the Dispatch Box to make legal decisions or judgments , but I assure my hon . Friend that the former Minister for development pledged £17 million to ensure that healthcare , food and shelter can reach tens of thousands of civilians , and to support vital infrastructure . My hon . Friend must reassure her constituents that the Foreign Office is doing all it can to get infrastructure across the OPTs and into Gaza , in order to relieve the suffering . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . The Israeli Government are wrong to prevent humanitarian aid entering Gaza . That threatens the lives of Gazans who are dependent on aid after the destruction of the past 15 months , and is a clear breach of international humanitarian law . What practical steps are the Government taking to ensure that the Israeli Government back down and let that aid in ? I understand the depth of distress in Israel about the despicable way that Hamas terrorists have played psychological games with the hostages and their families , but withholding essential supplies of food , medicine and shelter only worsens the devastation faced by the Palestinian people . In the west bank , we also see illegal settlers violently attacking Palestinians and apparently receiving the support of members of the Israeli Cabinet . Does the Minister agree that we in the UK must do all we can to undermine the extremists in this conflict , so that a second phase of the ceasefire can be negotiated , all hostages can be released , and Gazans can receive the aid that they desperately need ? I thank the Lib Dem spokesperson for his words . He is quite right to emphasise the psychological impact of this terrible conflict , and the traumatised state of people in the region . As the Foreign Secretary has said , we welcome the release of the 38 hostages in Gaza , including of course Emily Damari , whom we have already mentioned . We think so much of those members of the Lifshitz family — they of course had strong ties to the UK — who were held hostage by terrorists in Gaza and who died . We thank Qatar , Egypt and the US for providing support to ensure that the horrific ordeal of individuals and families can come to an end , but unfortunately , this is not the end .

The most important things the UK can do to build on the momentum of the important London Sudan conference — bearing in mind that we were the first to have such a conference — are to continue to base our work on the statement from its co - chairs ; to continue , as she says , to use our role at the United Nations ; and to work through the new friends of Sudan grouping to keep pushing at the highest level , using our position on the UN Security Council to galvanise its action and continue the important supply of aid into the region . I call the shadow Minister . I am grateful to you , Mr Speaker , for granting this urgent question , and my right hon . Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield ( Sir Andrew Mitchell ) for pursuing this matter . The situation in Sudan is dire . We are deeply concerned by the International Criminal Court ’ s findings last week that there are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity may be being committed in Darfur . The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate , with the UN warning on 30 June of drastic cuts to life - saving food aid for Sudanese refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries . Sudan has been identified as the global hunger hotspot of highest concern , and without immediate humanitarian assistance , the risk is terrible . With recent attacks on UN aid convoys , can the Minister provide her latest assessment of the situation and the extent of aid blocking ? How is she ensuring that UK aid — including the £120 million announced at the April Sudan conference — will reach those who need it , and that aid workers are protected ? More broadly , what new measures are the Government taking to compel the warring parties into a ceasefire , to allow more aid in and to facilitate deconfliction for its delivery in the meantime ? How has the Minister supported Sudanese civilian and political forces to engage in constructive dialogue processes such as the Cairo conference , and what is her assessment of the effectiveness of these processes ? Despite the spending review , we are yet to understand what the 0 . 3 % figure means for bilateral aid , so will she confirm the bilateral spend for Sudan this year ? Sudan matters . It is not in the UK ’ s national interests for the crossing of red lines in this conflict to persist , to have the displacement of people on this scale , nor to see the further destabilisation of this region of Africa . The right hon . Lady asked about the last week ’ s ICC finding . We acknowledge the ICC Office of the Prosecutor ’ s critical findings that there are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have well been committed , and are continuing to be committed , in Darfur . This is an important milestone in the ICC ’ s investigation into crimes committed in Darfur , and the UK remains steadfast in its commitment to ensure that international humanitarian law is respected and breaches are called out and investigated . The UK remains committed to securing accountability for those responsible for atrocity crimes . This includes reporting the fact - finding mission ’ s mandate and the ICC ’ s ongoing investigation . The right hon . Lady mentioned the attack on El Fasher and the targeting of aid workers . That is an absolute disgrace and a clear violation of international law , and we condemn it .

What steps he is taking with the Secretary of State for Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Affairs to increase the number of aid shipments to the middle east . There is a desperate need for increased humanitarian support to Gaza . The UK , including the Ministry of Defence , is working collectively with allies , partners and international organisations to deliver desperately needed aid to the Gazan population . My constituents are rightly proud of the work that our armed forces are doing to facilitate the delivery of aid , to prevent a colossal humanitarian catastrophe . What further steps can be taken to ensure that British aid finds its way to civilians in need , rather than into the hands of Hamas fighters ? That is one of the greatest challenges in the current situation . We are working with the British Red Cross , UNICEF , the UN World Food Programme , the Egyptian Red Crescent and others to ensure that aid gets to the right places . That is extremely challenging , and has slowed down aid delivery . The Israeli Government have said that they want to “ flood ” Gaza with aid . Will my right hon . Friend assure the House that we will work with our partners globally to get more aid into the hands of civilians in Gaza , and will assist the Israelis to deliver on that pledge as soon as possible ? I inform my hon . Friend that we have already delivered 74 tonnes of humanitarian aid via the RAF , and 87 tonnes through the Royal Fleet Auxiliary . In addition , we are pursuing land , air and maritime routes . With half of Gaza already starving and the rest teetering on the edge of famine , and the UN Security Council voting for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza , access to humanitarian aid is crucial . This month , the Foreign Secretary stated that the UK would support the building of a temporary pier in Gaza to allow hundreds of extra daily truckloads of aid into the strip . Will the Secretary of State outline what steps he is taking , along with the Foreign Secretary , to ensure that the pier is constructed as quickly as possible ? The hon . Lady will be pleased to hear that I have sent teams both to Tampa to work with US Central Command and to the region to help with planning and constructing that pier . In addition , right at the beginning of the conflict , I ensured that we did hydrographic research , to aid in exactly this kind of situation , when the conditions were right to get a pier built . This is not a trivial endeavour , but we are working to deliver the pier as quickly as possible ; there is the potential to get 2 . 5 million meals a day to Gaza . The UK Government ’ s ability to deliver humanitarian aid depends on the UK ’ s relationship with its middle eastern partners . What impact does the Secretary of State think that recent events and UK Government foreign policy decisions have had on that crucial relationship with those middle eastern partners ? The hon .

There are a number of different countries working with us to try to ensure that there is access to aid , which is desperately needed . I thank my right hon . Friend for all that she has done so far on this issue . My constituents , including Damon and Annie , are extremely concerned that every day things are only getting worse . The UN says that all essential supplies for survival are running out . Given the abject conditions in north Gaza , the fact that humanitarian access is nearly non - existent is unconscionable . A year on from the start of the conflict , we are still debating restrictions on the flow of aid by Israeli authorities . What more can my right hon . Friend do to ensure that people who are dying from hunger , thirst and lack of medical care receive the attention they need ? I can only underline the fact that the new UK Government are doing all that we can to get aid in as quickly as possible , supporting trusted partners on the ground to deliver life - saving humanitarian aid . As has been mentioned , we have agreed to match up to £10 million of public donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee ’ s middle east humanitarian appeal . That will provide life - saving aid , including medical supplies , shelter and clean water , to people in need , on top of the support that we have released to UNRWA . That aid needs to get to the people who desperately need it , and I refer to my response to an earlier question on that point . We are using every avenue to advance that cause . The images coming out of northern Gaza have horrified many , as has the news of yet more indiscriminate bombing , and many people have reached into humanity ’ s darkest periods for historical comparisons . I do not know which of those is appropriate , but I do know that on each of those occasions we told ourselves that this time was different , yet it never was . Does the ministerial team realise that what they do now is what they would have done then ? If they do , do they believe that the conversations that they are having are enough , and if they do not , when will they act positively to bring about a ceasefire ? I am grateful to the right hon . Member for his question , but he must recognise that from the first day of the new Government coming into position we have sought to do all we can to advance the cause of a ceasefire . On the issue of international humanitarian law , which he rightly and clearly stated as an imperative , we have been consistently clear as a new Government that Israel must comply with international humanitarian law . It must allow unfettered aid access . Our message is clear : Israel could and must do more to ensure that aid reaches civilians in Gaza .

From there we have to get the aid across the Rafah crossing , which , for all the reasons of complexity , is not always open or available . There are many restrictions to getting that aid in , but I am working very hard on that . The problem is not a lack of resource ; we have put in £30 million , more than doubling the existing £27 million , and I can assure the hon . Gentleman that there are further flights leaving later this month . For more than a month we have witnessed a distressing humanitarian disaster unfolding in Gaza . It is welcome that the RAF is flying UK humanitarian aid to the region , but so far we have seen only three RAF flights . When will the Government increase the number of flights and the amount of aid given to Palestinians , who have suffered so much and who deserve , at the very least , the basic essentials to try to survive ? The issue is not getting the aid to the region ; we could fly more aircraft . The issue is getting the aid into Gaza itself , and in that regard we have the problem of Hamas , a terrorist organisation not in the least bit interested in looking after the citizens of Gaza , and , of course , the problem of the Rafah crossing , which is opened and closed on a fairly arbitrary basis . However , I can assure the hon . Lady that we are working very hard with all the different bodies and Governments in the region to get more of that aid in as quickly as possible .

Some 13 , 000 eligible persons and their families are now in the UK under the ARAP scheme . We are determined to deliver on our commitments , with many hundreds more arrivals in the UK planned before the end of the year . In the light of Pakistan ’ s brutal crackdown on undocumented and temporary visa - bearing Afghan refugees and its forcible deportation of those people back to Afghanistan , can the Minister confirm the security of those eligible for the Afghan citizens resettlement and ARAP schemes in Pakistan , including many whose claims have been unprocessed for two years ? Can he expedite those claims to stop people being thrown back into the clutches of the Taliban ? May I gently encourage Members on both sides of the House to change their tone when describing the Government of Pakistan in relation to these matters ? We would not have brought out thousands of people had it not been for the support of the Government of Pakistan , and we continue to enjoy their support and co - operation in our efforts to bring out many thousands more . As the hon .

In respect of South Sudan , where there is a significant and increased programme of humanitarian support , we have directly contributed nearly £8 million . I recently met the community president and secretary general of the Sudanese Community Association of Greater Manchester . We discussed the horrific civil war in Sudan and the desperate need to bring about a peaceful and sustainable end to the conflict . The war may be taking place in Sudan , but it has huge implications for Sudanese communities in Britain , like the one in Manchester . What support is the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office providing Sudanese communities in Britain , who are trying to support their loved ones who are fleeing from violence to reach a place of safety ? There is very little we can do until those people reach a place of safety . As I said , many have fled across the border into Chad and South Sudan . We are actively helping those people in the way that I described . Sudan is experiencing the worst displacement crisis in the world . It is not so much a civil war but a war on civilians , who are losing their homes , livelihoods and lives on a scale that is hard to comprehend . The Sudanese people feel forgotten , so it is vital that both aid and political focus are forthcoming . Will the Minister work with his Home Office colleagues to support Sudanese people in the asylum system , who are beside themselves with worry about family members ? Will he better facilitate reunion for those UK citizens who have family among the most affected and who are able to leave ? We will do everything we can to assist . The hon . Lady will understand the constraints we work within , but I will note what she said . If she has any specific cases that she wishes to raise , I hope she will do so . Given the level of death , despair and starvation , we need an immediate ceasefire in Sudan . Cross - border and cross - line humanitarian aid access is being blocked and impaired by both sides , even though they are , in effect , starving their own people to death . What steps are the Government taking to get the Adré crossing open , and to expose the impact of RSF extortion on humanitarian aid convoys ? I was in Adré when I visited the border between Chad and Sudan . I saw the weight of human misery crossing that border — 88 % of those crossing were women and children , which shows that the men had either been murdered or gone into hiding . The hon . Gentleman is quite right about the importance of Adré . He is right about the two generals effectively waging war on their own people — starving their own people , as he said . That is why everyone is urging the two generals to desist , get their troops back to barracks and give a chance for a political track to reconvene and re - emerge . What assurance can the Minister give the Sudanese community in Newport — who , as others have said , feel that the conflict and its catastrophic consequences have gone largely unseen — that the Government are doing all they can to get aid in through the Adré crossing , and are trying as hard as they can to build consensus among neighbouring and regional states that the war must end ?", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-22.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-22.txt"}, {"score": 0.6282236576080322, "chunk_id": "debates2024-01-30_F9", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-01-30.txt", "date": "2024-01-30", "parliament": "UK", "text": "What assessment he has made of the impact of the UK ’ s non - military support to Ukraine over winter 2023 - 24 on the humanitarian situation in that country . What recent diplomatic support he has provided to Ukraine . What discussions he has had with his international counterparts on maintaining support for Ukraine . What recent discussions he has had with his international counterparts on the war in Ukraine . Since February 2020 the UK has committed £357 million of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine . In response to winter we scaled up humanitarian support with additional funding to provide cash assistance , insulation , and support for energy and heating . The Foreign Secretary ’ s first overseas visit was to Ukraine . He continues to set out the UK ambition to international partners and did so in November during NATO and OSCE gatherings , and most recently at Davos , where he met Foreign Minister Kuleba . Tim Bamford , our local councillor for Denby Dale , has devoted his own time and expense to making several potentially dangerous excursions , driving a truck to deliver essential humanitarian aid to war - torn Ukraine alongside volunteers from the Yorkshire Aid Convoy . Will the Minister join me in thanking Tim — who is sitting in the Public Gallery — and all the fantastic team at the Yorkshire Aid Convoy for everything that they are doing to help the Ukrainian people , and wish them a safe journey for their next trip in March ? I am delighted to join my hon . Friend in thanking Tim and Tina Bamford , both of whom are in the Public Gallery . The response of the British people to the tragedy in Ukraine has been remarkable and hugely generous , and we salute the courage and generosity of spirit shown by the commendable actions of the Yorkshire Aid Convoy . There are many billions of Russian assets frozen by western nations , and there is a strong moral case for Ukraine to use those assets to repel Russia ’ s aggression and rebuild its own economy . What progress has the Department made in talking to other nations to make that a reality ? I agree that there is a strong moral case for using Russian assets to repair the damage that Russia has wrought on Ukraine . We are clear about the fact that Russia should pay , and we continue to assess what legal path there might be to achieving that end . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recently said : “ I think the big difference from last year to this year is that this year…There is somehow a trend towards getting used to Ukrainian suffering . ” It is more than 200 days since the Opposition tabled a motion necessitating Government legislation to bring about the full seizure and repurposing of Russian state assets within 90 days , but no plan has yet been forthcoming . Why are the Government so out of step with our allies and partners in this regard ? We are not out of step ; we are leading the pack , and have been doing so for the last two years . Our resolve is shown by our own financial commitment but also by our permanent commitment to the UK - Ukraine relationship , which was demonstrated when the Prime Minister signed the UK - Ukraine agreement on security co - operation at the start of the year . We are in it for the long haul . Tomorrow Jens Stoltenberg , the Secretary - General of NATO , will meet representatives of the Heritage Foundation , a Republican - leaning think - tank . He will meet allies of former President Trump in an effort to unlock $ 60 billion of funding for Ukraine .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-01-30.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-01-30.txt"}, {"score": 0.6196762323379517, "chunk_id": "debates2023-12-04_F21", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-12-04.txt", "date": "2023-12-04", "parliament": "UK", "text": "A tragedy is unfolding in the middle east . Israel has suffered the worst terror attack in its history , and Palestinian civilians are experiencing a devastating and growing humanitarian crisis . As the Foreign Secretary made clear , last week ’ s agreement was a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian emergency in Gaza . This pause has provided an opportunity to ensure that much greater volumes of food , fuel and other lifesaving aid can enter Gaza . On 24 November , the British Government announced a further £30 million - worth of humanitarian assistance , tripling our existing aid budget for the Occupied Palestinian Territories this financial year and bringing it to a total of £60 million . During the pause , the fourth UK aircraft , carrying 23 tonnes of humanitarian aid for Gaza , arrived in Egypt , bringing the total amount of UK humanitarian aid provided by British aircraft to 74 tonnes . That aid is now being dispersed to the United Nations to support critical food , water , health , shelter and protection needs in Gaza , and to pre - position emergency supplies in the region . We are also actively exploring other aid routes , including by sea . The pause that ended last week was a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza . We have said repeatedly that we would like to see an extension . UK humanitarian funding will continue to support trusted partners to provide humanitarian assistance , and negotiate humanitarian access , in Gaza . The UK will continue , in conjunction with our international partners , to advocate internationally on humanitarian priorities . These include respect for international humanitarian law , the need for fuel , humanitarian access , humanitarian pauses and an increase in the types of assistance . We are urgently exploring all diplomatic options to increase that , including urging Israel to open other existing land borders , such as Kerem Shalom . We welcome the intensive international co - operation , including efforts from Qatar and the USA , which led to the agreement , and we thank partners for their continued work . We remain committed to making progress towards a two - state solution . Britain ’ s long - standing position on the middle east peace process is clear : we support a negotiated settlement leading to a safe and secure Israel living alongside a viable and sovereign Palestinian state . The UK will continue to work with all partners in the region to reach a long - term political solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace . Given recent events , it is surprising and regrettable that neither the Prime Minister nor the Foreign Secretary is making a statement today . The reality is that this conflict has sadly reached another phase , and many more innocent lives will be lost if we do not act now . We urge the Government to continue to push for another cessation of hostilities and for all remaining hostages to be freed . To be clear , Israel must not besiege or blockade Gaza . It must comply with international law and protect innocent lives and civilian infrastructure , and ensure that attempts to address the humanitarian catastrophe are ramped up quickly . In the last few days , partners on the ground have become increasingly concerned about the safe zone at al - Mawasi , with reports suggesting that aid is not reaching those who are there . Have the Government held talks with Israel and others to ensure that it does , and to seek assurances that Palestinians who fled there not will not be moved further still ?

Support for Ukraine and for Gaza have survived the disastrous cuts to ODA , but what assessments has the Department made of the impact of ODA reductions on countries facing humanitarian and natural disasters , and can the UK still provide the amount of aid needed to prevent displacement and migration as a result of those crises ? The hon . Member raises important issues . We have seen horrific scenes in Afghanistan , and he will know that we gave £1 million yesterday . We have also seen terrible scenes in Sudan this morning . He will know that tackling the climate and nature emergency around the world is a priority for us , and we continue to support humanitarian work around the world . Of course , responding to disasters remains a key part of that , and we have demonstrated that repeatedly in a number of contexts , through the support that we have given . Could the Minister update the House on the reduction in assistance to places including Myanmar , and on democracy there , and the imprisonment of Daw Suu ? We have to make very difficult choices as a result of the decision we made . We remain absolutely committed to international development . The detailed allocations will be set out in due course , and they will of course be informed by impact assessments before we publish multi - year allocations . I call the shadow Minister . At a time when we face global development spending reductions across critical areas such as global health , women , peace and security , girls ’ education , water , sanitation and hygiene , and nutrition , Ministers have chosen to increase energy and climate spending by £244 million — an increase of 59 % . Could the Minister explain the rationale for that significant increase and outline how those funds will be allocated , particularly as , unlike in 2024 - 25 , no breakdown of political priorities is available for scrutiny ? As I have just said , we will set out the detailed allocations in due course ; they will be informed by impact assessments . The right hon . Member rightly raises the issue of women and girls . Of course , less money does not mean less action , and we see our work on women and girls as essential for development and our UK missions overseas . We have appointed Baroness Harman as a UK special envoy for women and girls . We are amplifying the voices of women ’ s organisations and movements , including in climate - affected contexts , and embedding gender equality across our international action .

There are many restrictions to getting that aid in , but I am working very hard on that . The problem is not a lack of resource ; we have put in £30 million , more than doubling the existing £27 million , and I can assure the hon . Gentleman that there are further flights leaving later this month . For more than a month we have witnessed a distressing humanitarian disaster unfolding in Gaza . It is welcome that the RAF is flying UK humanitarian aid to the region , but so far we have seen only three RAF flights . When will the Government increase the number of flights and the amount of aid given to Palestinians , who have suffered so much and who deserve , at the very least , the basic essentials to try to survive ? The issue is not getting the aid to the region ; we could fly more aircraft . The issue is getting the aid into Gaza itself , and in that regard we have the problem of Hamas , a terrorist organisation not in the least bit interested in looking after the citizens of Gaza , and , of course , the problem of the Rafah crossing , which is opened and closed on a fairly arbitrary basis . However , I can assure the hon . Lady that we are working very hard with all the different bodies and Governments in the region to get more of that aid in as quickly as possible .

Clearly , the most important thing right now is humanitarian aid , but there will be a requirement for long - term rebuilding of the structures that have been destroyed . The British people will want to be generous but , as my hon . Friend the Member for Bridgwater and West Somerset ( Mr Liddell - Grainger ) mentioned , there is a risk that funds will be diverted to improper uses . When a fund is set up to which the British people can contribute , will my hon . Friend make sure that the British people know how to contribute to it and that it goes to the people who need it ? My hon . Friend makes a good point , which has been reiterated by other Members : the money needs to get to the frontline . We will do everything we can , certainly with those funds provided by the UK Government and through the UN ; that will be a key focus . The fact that so many colleagues are raising the issue helps us to make that point with conviction . On his wider point , the primary focus right now is humanitarian need , but going forward , Libya needs to move down a pathway to free and fair elections . That will help the country in the longer term , but humanitarian aid and support is our key focus right now . I join colleagues in offering my condolences to all those who have lost loved ones in the devastation in Libya . In my constituency and in many other parts of the country there are strong Libyan diaspora communities watching on in despair , unsure about the whereabouts of their loved ones . Will the Minister confirm what support is available to Libyan communities and others in the UK to gain information about friends and family in Libya ? Our embassy staff are working closely with people on the ground , keeping in touch with what is going on , and our consular support team is keeping in touch with dual nationals in Libya , providing the support they need . They will continue to do that . Our condolences go not only to the people of Libya but to the wider diaspora as well . We will continue to do everything we can , as hon . Members on all sides of the House have urged — that message has been well received today . I fully support the fact that the UK Government have provided international assistance to the people of Libya , but what are we doing specifically to ensure humanitarian assistance is urgently getting to people on the ground today ? As I say , we have made our initial offer of support . We continue to have an active dialogue with the Libyan authorities and the UN . As I said to the Opposition spokesperson , the hon .

The tragic scenes we are witnessing in Libya are utterly horrifying ; my thoughts and prayers are with all those affected . During the earthquakes in Syria and Turkey , my noble Friend Lord Purvis asked “ why the Government ’ s humanitarian crisis reserve , which recently stood at £500 million , has now been depleted to only £30 million , which means that the UK ’ s response to any other emergencies or disasters will be greatly reduced . ” — [ Official Report , House of Lords , 6 March 2023 ; Vol .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-09-14.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-09-14.txt"}, {"score": 0.6069408655166626, "chunk_id": "debates2025-02-06_F23", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-02-06.txt", "date": "2025-02-06", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Let me turn to the right hon . Lady ’ s questions . She asked about the turnaround times for UK aid getting into Gaza . Certainly we have seen a far speedier throughput , but I am sure that she would agree that we need to see commercial shipments of goods getting into Gaza ; that is necessary if there is to be delivery of food and other supplies on the scale that is required . We continue to push the Government of Israel to enable that to happen as quickly as possible . As for the metrics being used when it comes to the distribution of that aid , we are working closely with trusted partners , and as the right hon . Lady would expect , we continuously monitor the distribution of UK supplies . Much of our activity has been undertaken jointly with other countries , as well as with UN agencies , and we work closely with them to ensure that aid is delivered where it is needed . Lastly , the right hon . Lady asked whether there had been a change in types of aid . We need access for tents in particular , as well as other forms of shelter and medical supplies . When I was in Jordan , I saw medical supplies that it had not been possible to deliver to Gaza , and we need access for those . We have seen improvements in some areas , but given the scale of the challenge , we need to see further improvements , especially in relation to water and sanitation where there has been a great deal of destruction . Urgent action is needed to improve the position . rose — To those Members who were seven minutes late , please do not embarrass each other by standing . We have seen a really worrying escalation of violence on the west bank , just at the time when this fragile peace has been found in Gaza . Large parts of Jenin refugee camp have been completely destroyed by Israeli security forces , and thousands have been forcibly displaced . UNRWA services have been interrupted . What measures is the Minister taking to ensure that Palestinians can live safely and securely in their homes on the west bank ? I am grateful to my hon . Friend for raising this issue . She has considerable expertise in the area of humanitarian support , as do many other Members in the Chamber . As I said in my previous response , the UK is very concerned about the situation in Jenin , which we continue to monitor very carefully . We are clear that peace and stability on the west bank is in everyone ’ s interests — it is in the state of Israel ’ s interests , and in the interests of Palestinians . On 18 December , in a statement at the UN Security Council meeting on the Occupied Palestinian Territories , the UK called on Israel to stop illegal settlement expansion on Palestinian land , and we are considering all options for taking further action . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . President Trump ’ s proposals for the forced displacement of Gaza ’ s 2 . 2 million inhabitants would constitute a grave violation of international law , and threaten the fragile ceasefire and the return of the hostages .

We need an immediate end to the fighting and to secure the release of the hostages , whose families continue to suffer unbearable torment on a daily basis , so will the right hon . Gentleman please provide an update to the House on reassurances he has received on the safety of the hostages ? On aid , in his meetings has the Foreign Secretary secured any reassurances to increase the number of trucks going into Gaza ? Seventy - odd a day is just not enough . In government , we did everything we could to urge Israel to let more humanitarian aid into Gaza and open more crossings , including through Rafah , and we trebled our own aid commitment within the last financial year , doing everything we could to get aid there by land , sea or air . We had success in getting the Ashdod port open , as well as Kerem Shalom , and helped get 11 airdrops into Gaza . The field hospital provided by UK aid funding to UK - Med has treated thousands of patients . We also supported and helped to set up a maritime aid corridor to Gaza . The right hon . Gentleman announced today the return of funding to UNRWA . Can he please advise the House on the timeline for that , and provide assurances that taxpayers ’ funding will be directed with due regard ? Only an end to the fighting will enable a significant scaling up of humanitarian aid . The right hon . Gentleman rightly stated that Biden set forward a proposal backed by Israel and the UN Security Council to end the hostilities . What action is he taking to move that proposal forward ? Can he also provide us with any reassurances he has secured in his meetings with Netanyahu ? He rightly raised the case of extremist settlers ; we were one of the first Governments to put in place sanctions against some of them . Can he assure us that he raised this issue with the Israeli Government , and whether more sanctions will be forthcoming ? The risk of escalation remains high , particularly with Hezbollah in Lebanon , so can I please ask whether his Department assesses any change in Iranian intent , activities or funding following the sham election of the Iranian President ? When they sat on the Opposition Benches , both the right hon . Gentleman and the now Home Secretary were crystal clear that , were they in government , they would proscribe the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , so can we please now have the timing for this proscription ? We all want to see an end to this devastating situation , which threatens the stability and security of so many . As His Majesty ’ s loyal Opposition , our priority will be to work with the Government , but also to challenge and scrutinise them as needed .

In recent weeks , the Royal Air Force has conducted seven airdrops along the Gazan coast , delivering more than 58 tonnes of food . The UK - Med field hospital , funded by the UK , is up and running in Gaza and has already treated more than 8 , 000 people , a high proportion of them children . We need to see the operating environment in Gaza improve , so that more aid gets in and can be distributed quickly , safely and effectively . Israel must ensure that the UN has the access , equipment and staff that it needs to do that . We were horrified by the attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy , which killed seven aid workers , including three very dedicated British nationals . Israel must do more to protect aid workers , including through guaranteed deconfliction for aid convoys and other humanitarian work to ensure that they can operate safely . The findings of Israel ’ s investigation must be published in full , and followed up with a wholly independent review , to ensure the utmost transparency and accountability . Six months on , however much we might wish otherwise , the fighting has not yet come to an end . We cannot and will not stand by . The Foreign Secretary is in the region this week , pressing for further action . Thank you , Mr Speaker , for granting me this urgent question . Conditions in Gaza are desperate and intolerable . Famine is taking hold , sewage is pooling in the streets and the water has still not been switched back on . Almost nothing is reaching northern Gaza , where people are already dying of starvation . The healthcare system has been utterly devastated . Yesterday , leading non - governmental organisations told me about specific blocks and restrictions that they face from Israeli authorities in doing their life - saving work . Aid is sat waiting , unable to reach those in need , with some rotting where it stood . Items are removed from trucks without explanation , and doctors are reusing single - use medical equipment taken from patients who have died . Today , a UN report says that 10 , 000 women have been killed . That is a description of hell on earth . It cannot go on . For months , we have demanded that aid flow without restrictions — unfettered and unimpeded — at a level that meets humanitarian need . The UN Security Council has demanded it ; the International Court of Justice has ordered it . However , despite the pledges that have been made , UN figures show that more aid went in on some days in January than went in yesterday , so I have three questions for the Government . First , can the Minster be clear that Israel is not meeting its commitments , and about what pressure the Government are applying to change that ? Secondly , why have the Government not yet announced that they are restoring future funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ? It is shocking that , in the face of famine , the UK is one of the last major donors yet to resume funding , without explanation . Thirdly , why are the Government seemingly softening their message to Netanyahu on Rafah ? Let us be clear : 1 . 5 million Palestinians sheltering there have nowhere safe to go . There can be no humanitarian operation to meet the scale of need without an immediate ceasefire now . Both sides must agree to comply . We note that it was Hamas and their leader , Sinwar , who rejected the latest ceasefire deal .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-17.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-17.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2024-02-19.txt | debates2024-02-19_F4 | 2024-02-19 | UK", "debates2024-04-17.txt | debates2024-04-17_F20 | 2024-04-17 | UK", "debates2024-07-19.txt | debates2024-07-19_F18 | 2024-07-19 | UK", "debates2025-01-23.txt | debates2025-01-23_F11 | 2025-01-23 | UK", "debates2025-10-28.txt | debates2025-10-28_F12 | 2025-10-28 | UK"], "answer": "The speech dates are: 2024-02-19, 2024-04-17, 2024-07-19, 2025-01-23, 2025-10-28.

Media reports have suggested that white men have been actively discriminated against in recruitment , and that security checks may be relaxed due to promoting ethnic diversity within the Army . A number of senior military figures have purportedly warned that the pervasiveness of woke ideology being pushed on to the armed forces is a real and present threat to national security , and will give aid and comfort to the King ’ s enemies . Will the planned review of diversity policies seek to address those concerns ? I am grateful for the hon . Gentleman ’ s remarks , but I do not recognise the situation that he describes . We take security extremely seriously and ensure that all personnel have security clearance appropriate to their job . Checks normally require at least three years ’ UK residency , but Commonwealth candidates are permitted to accrue qualifying residency while serving , although they cannot take up roles and ranks that require higher levels of vetting . This policy has been in place for several years , and it has not changed . Figures in The Times last month showed that the British Army will shrink to as small as 67 , 000 by 2026 due to the crisis in recruitment and retention . As threats to the UK increase , will the Minister finally commit to halting the cuts that he continues to make to the Army ? The Government are sticking to 73 , 000 regular and 30 , 000 reserved personnel , as I said earlier . Those figures are in “ Future Soldier ” , published in 2021 , and they remain unchanged . What steps his Department is taking to assist in the provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza . The Ministry of Defence continues to stand ready to support the effort , led by the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office , to pursue land , air and maritime routes to deliver urgently needed humanitarian aid . Many of my constituents in Stoke - on - Trent South are extremely concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and want to see much more aid getting into Gaza . It is vital for the innocent civilian population there . Will the Secretary of State update us on what more is being done to ensure additional routes , and particularly a sea route , into Gaza for humanitarian aid to innocent civilians ? My hon . Friend will be pleased to hear that I have been to the region on a number of occasions — I have visited Israel and Cyprus twice , as well as visiting Egypt and Saudi Arabia — with the specific intention of trying to resolve the problem that he describes .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-02-19.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-02-19.txt"}, {"score": 25.486340647448234, "chunk_id": "debates2025-01-23_F11", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-01-23.txt", "date": "2025-01-23", "parliament": "UK", "text": "At the heart of what we want to do is improving living standards , outcomes and opportunities for all . One of the consequences of the long waiting times and waiting lists in the NHS in recent years is that it has been tougher on those who simply cannot afford to pay . It is therefore in the interests of good health and equal access to put in the investment that was announced by the Chancellor in the Budget , which is being taken forward in the plans announced by my right hon . Friend the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care . The reform of public services and the reliance on artificial intelligence to deliver that led the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs to pilot the Microsoft Copilot program . That pilot ended after six months , yet it demonstrated transformative improvements in departmental efficiency and was particularly beneficial for disabled and neurodivergent staff . Will the Minister confirm whether funding for that tool , which has been suspended until 2026 , could be released so that staff could benefit from its application ? The hon . Gentleman is quite right to point out the advantages that can come from these things . I am reluctant to make specific announcements about funding for specific projects . However , the Government are determined not only to make the UK a good home for investment in AI , which will be huge around the world in the coming years , but to make the best possible use of AI in the delivery of public services , which we believe can get good value for money and better outcomes for the public . The road will not always be easy , and there will be things that go wrong , but frankly , with our tradition of creativity and innovation , we want to grasp this technology and make the best use of it . What steps he is taking to reduce fraud in the public sector . Yesterday , the Government announced ambitious new legislation to take action on fraud , updating the Department for Work and Pensions ’ powers for the first time in 20 years and introducing new powers to take on high - value fraud across the wider public sector . At the Budget , the Chancellor announced the biggest welfare fraud and error budget in recent history . Under the last Government , fraud spiralled out of control , but we are determined to protect every pound of taxpayers ’ money . I thank my hon . Friend for her answer . One of the biggest scandals that we saw under the last Conservative Government was Ministers giving out dodgy covid contracts to their friends and donors . Will the Minister update the House on what steps the Government are taking to ensure that there will never again be a repeat of that shameful behaviour and that where the public have been defrauded , we will get our money back ? My hon . Friend , as a local government leader during the pandemic , will know how hard things were for communities ; sacrifices were made and people risked their lives to keep the rest of us safe . He will share my anger at those who used the national crisis to steal billions from the taxpayer . We will take action on that where the last Government failed . The Public Authorities ( Fraud , Error and Recovery ) Bill , which was introduced yesterday , will give the Government tough new powers to investigate and recover money stolen from the public and will double the time we have to bring those fraudsters to justice . What steps he is taking to reform public procurement . Under this Government , public procurement will be laser focused on delivering our missions and value for money for the taxpayer .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-01-23.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-01-23.txt"}, {"score": 25.398621767080527, "chunk_id": "debates2025-10-28_F12", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-10-28.txt", "date": "2025-10-28", "parliament": "UK", "text": "How will the Government maximise the opportunity of the World Service , which is one of our best soft power assets and the best way that we can have conversations with the rest of the world ?

He will be aware that the charter review starts next year , and we think that is one of the best ways we can work towards establishing the funding streams . We are working with the BBC World Service on ways in which it can innovate to ensure that it reaches even further , as the most trusted news network on the globe . I recently met senior journalists who have been exiled from Russia , following Putin ’ s clampdown on any form of free , trustworthy media . Despite the huge challenges , they are still providing vital , accurate reporting for all those in the region who need it most . Will the Minister commit to sustainable funding guarantees for our soft power , and continue to support these courageous journalists , who are forced to move countries , and are often threatened by rogue states ? I agree with my hon . Friend about the work of the BBC World Service , and we are working with the BBC . I am shortly due to visit Broadcasting House to see at first hand the work it is doing , particularly its innovative work to deliver and develop its funding programmes , which will form part of the charter review . In response to Russian interference in the media around the world , I echo my hon . Friend ’ s support for the journalists who work in the World Service , who do so much to expose what is happening globally , particularly around conflict . What steps her Department is taking to help improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza . What diplomatic steps she is taking to help ensure that humanitarian aid can reach people in Gaza . Alongside our international partners , the UK is working to get aid into Gaza on the scale needed to ease the desperate humanitarian crisis that is taking place . In recent days , the Foreign Secretary has spoken with Tom Fletcher of the United Nations , Egyptian Foreign Minister Abdelatty and Israeli Foreign Minister Sa ’ ar about the importance of opening more crossings and removing all restrictions on aid . We are ready to play our full part in providing that aid . We have announced £74 million of humanitarian funding already this year , including the £20 million announced at the peace summit in Egypt . I fully support the Minister in welcoming the US - brokered ceasefire , which has enabled the delivery of much - needed humanitarian aid into Gaza . As the Minister is aware , the UN and its partners have significantly scaled up their operations providing essential supplies , such as food , water , medical aid and fuel . However , given that border closures and ongoing political tensions continue to obstruct the flow of assistance , what steps are the Government taking to ensure unimpeded humanitarian access , and to prevent aid being used as a tool of political leverage ? My hon . Friend is absolutely right . Following the US - led ceasefire agreement and the UN ’ s work , more trucks are starting to cross the border , but that needs to be scaled up much more rapidly , and we need the Rafah crossing fully opened , alongside other aid routes . We need international non - governmental organisations in , and able to operate in Gaza unimpeded .

Gentleman rightly set out , the situation in Gaza is desperate . Too many Palestinian civilians have been killed . We continue to see strikes on humanitarian infrastructure and the humanitarian situation is unforgivable . The index on famine states that Gaza is now in just that : full famine . I saw this when I went on my own visit to the Egyptian border with Gaza and met families who had had to be evacuated due to the severity of the harm caused to them . We need an immediate end to the fighting and to secure the release of the hostages , whose families continue to suffer unbearable torment on a daily basis , so will the right hon . Gentleman please provide an update to the House on reassurances he has received on the safety of the hostages ? On aid , in his meetings has the Foreign Secretary secured any reassurances to increase the number of trucks going into Gaza ? Seventy - odd a day is just not enough . In government , we did everything we could to urge Israel to let more humanitarian aid into Gaza and open more crossings , including through Rafah , and we trebled our own aid commitment within the last financial year , doing everything we could to get aid there by land , sea or air . We had success in getting the Ashdod port open , as well as Kerem Shalom , and helped get 11 airdrops into Gaza . The field hospital provided by UK aid funding to UK - Med has treated thousands of patients . We also supported and helped to set up a maritime aid corridor to Gaza . The right hon . Gentleman announced today the return of funding to UNRWA . Can he please advise the House on the timeline for that , and provide assurances that taxpayers ’ funding will be directed with due regard ? Only an end to the fighting will enable a significant scaling up of humanitarian aid . The right hon . Gentleman rightly stated that Biden set forward a proposal backed by Israel and the UN Security Council to end the hostilities . What action is he taking to move that proposal forward ? Can he also provide us with any reassurances he has secured in his meetings with Netanyahu ? He rightly raised the case of extremist settlers ; we were one of the first Governments to put in place sanctions against some of them . Can he assure us that he raised this issue with the Israeli Government , and whether more sanctions will be forthcoming ? The risk of escalation remains high , particularly with Hezbollah in Lebanon , so can I please ask whether his Department assesses any change in Iranian intent , activities or funding following the sham election of the Iranian President ? When they sat on the Opposition Benches , both the right hon . Gentleman and the now Home Secretary were crystal clear that , were they in government , they would proscribe the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , so can we please now have the timing for this proscription ? We all want to see an end to this devastating situation , which threatens the stability and security of so many . As His Majesty ’ s loyal Opposition , our priority will be to work with the Government , but also to challenge and scrutinise them as needed . Ultimately , we can assure the Government that we will always work in the national interest because it is foreign policy that keeps our people safe at home , and that is our foremost duty .

We need to see the operating environment in Gaza improve , so that more aid gets in and can be distributed quickly , safely and effectively . Israel must ensure that the UN has the access , equipment and staff that it needs to do that . We were horrified by the attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy , which killed seven aid workers , including three very dedicated British nationals . Israel must do more to protect aid workers , including through guaranteed deconfliction for aid convoys and other humanitarian work to ensure that they can operate safely . The findings of Israel ’ s investigation must be published in full , and followed up with a wholly independent review , to ensure the utmost transparency and accountability . Six months on , however much we might wish otherwise , the fighting has not yet come to an end . We cannot and will not stand by . The Foreign Secretary is in the region this week , pressing for further action . Thank you , Mr Speaker , for granting me this urgent question . Conditions in Gaza are desperate and intolerable . Famine is taking hold , sewage is pooling in the streets and the water has still not been switched back on . Almost nothing is reaching northern Gaza , where people are already dying of starvation . The healthcare system has been utterly devastated . Yesterday , leading non - governmental organisations told me about specific blocks and restrictions that they face from Israeli authorities in doing their life - saving work . Aid is sat waiting , unable to reach those in need , with some rotting where it stood . Items are removed from trucks without explanation , and doctors are reusing single - use medical equipment taken from patients who have died . Today , a UN report says that 10 , 000 women have been killed . That is a description of hell on earth . It cannot go on . For months , we have demanded that aid flow without restrictions — unfettered and unimpeded — at a level that meets humanitarian need . The UN Security Council has demanded it ; the International Court of Justice has ordered it . However , despite the pledges that have been made , UN figures show that more aid went in on some days in January than went in yesterday , so I have three questions for the Government . First , can the Minster be clear that Israel is not meeting its commitments , and about what pressure the Government are applying to change that ? Secondly , why have the Government not yet announced that they are restoring future funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ? It is shocking that , in the face of famine , the UK is one of the last major donors yet to resume funding , without explanation . Thirdly , why are the Government seemingly softening their message to Netanyahu on Rafah ? Let us be clear : 1 . 5 million Palestinians sheltering there have nowhere safe to go . There can be no humanitarian operation to meet the scale of need without an immediate ceasefire now . Both sides must agree to comply . We note that it was Hamas and their leader , Sinwar , who rejected the latest ceasefire deal .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-17.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-17.txt"}, {"score": 25.09932020896341, "chunk_id": "debates2024-02-21_F6", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-02-21.txt", "date": "2024-02-21", "parliament": "UK", "text": "However , it is only the good stewardship of our economy that has allowed us to continue to invest record amounts in research and innovation in the UK .

To support that , we have established a central co - ordination function , which will provide regulators with guidance on implementing the regulatory principles and help them to identify emerging risks and challenges . The £10 million funding we have announced to jump - start regulator capacity and capability will form a crucial element of this work . AI in the UK still lacks sufficient regulation , despite the pace of change and the risks posed . The Government stated that they expect to introduce “ a statutory duty on regulators requiring them to have due regard ” to the five high - level principles outlined in the AI White Paper . So will the Secretary of State confirm if and when she will legislate for that , and what factors will inform her decision ? The risks of AI are still emerging , so the priority of this Government is keeping pace with those risks , to keep the public safe . That is why we have an agile , sector - specific approach , utilising our world - leading regulators , whereas the Opposition keep calling for legislation on an area they do not understand .

This month , we have set out our pro - innovation , pro - safety plans to regulate artificial intelligence , building on the success of the AI safety summit to cement Britain ’ s position as a global leader in safe and trustworthy AI . We are slashing red tape to free our researchers from pointless paperwork . We have a plan to go even further and become a science and technology superpower , and that plan is working . Higher salary requirements and visa charges for skilled workers plus impossibly restrictive family visa rules will put the UK out of reach for many early career researchers and scientists .

( Urgent Question ) : To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Affairs if he will make a statement on the humanitarian situation in Gaza . The deputy Foreign Secretary is regrettably unable to respond to this question in person , as he is at the World Bank spring meetings in Washington . I will respond on his behalf . Earlier this month , we passed a grim milestone : six months since Hamas ’ s horrific terrorist attack on Israel . The UK Government have been working with partners across the region to secure the release of hostages , including British nationals . We want to see the release of all hostages . Palestinian civilians have spent these months suffering , with conditions worsening by the day . The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire . The Iran attack and our support for Israel have not changed our focus on ensuring that Israel meets its commitments to enable at least 500 aid trucks a day to enter Gaza ; to open Ashdod port for aid deliveries ; to expand the Jordan land corridor ; to open a crossing into northern Gaza ; and to extend hours at Kerem Shalom and Nitzana . We are pushing as hard as we can to get aid to Palestinian civilians . As this House knows , we have been urging Israel at the highest levels to take immediate action on the bottlenecks holding up humanitarian relief . We have recently seen a small increase in the number of aid trucks being allowed to enter Gaza , but not all of them are full , and numbers are not yet close to reaching the levels required given the severity of the humanitarian situation that we now see . We will continue to press Israel to take immediate action to open Ashdod fully for humanitarian aid . Meanwhile , we recently announced new support for a life - saving aid corridor by sea to Gaza , including the deployment of a Royal Navy ship , which has now arrived in the Mediterranean and is ready to integrate with the US pier , and provide a command and control platform . We are also committing up to £9 . 7 million for aid deliveries through that corridor , as well as providing logistical expertise and equipment . In recent weeks , the Royal Air Force has conducted seven airdrops along the Gazan coast , delivering more than 58 tonnes of food .

My right hon . Friend is another good example of a Member who is an excellent champion for her constituents , on this issue and so many others . As for her specific point , it is right for the industry to work out how it will increase provision and adapt the criteria for rural areas , but I will work with her to ensure that the banking hubs are rolled out in an equitable way , to rural as well as more urban areas . Urgent Question ) To ask the Secretary of State if he will make a statement on the situation in Gaza and Israel . I thank the right hon . Gentleman for his question . Israel suffered the worst terrorist attack in its history on 7 October last year . The scenes that we saw on that day were appalling , and Hamas ’ s disregard for civilian welfare continues today , more than five months later . We remember all the time those who are still being held hostage and their families , and we call once again for their immediate release . However , we naturally remain deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the impact of the conflict on all Palestinian civilians . We have borne witness to death and displacement on a vast scale . More than 1 , 700 , 000 people have had to leave their home , many on multiple occasions . We are deeply concerned about the growing risk of famine , exacerbated by the spread of disease , and , of course , about the terrible psychosocial impacts of the conflict , which will be felt for years to come . We are totally committed to getting humanitarian aid to all those people in Gaza who desperately need it , doing so either ourselves or through UN agencies and British or other charities . We and our partners are pushing to get aid in through all feasible means , by land , sea and air . We have trebled our aid funding to the Occupied Palestinian Territories this year , providing just under £100 million , of which £70 million has been delivered as humanitarian assistance . On 13 March a further 150 tonnes of UK aid arrived in Gaza , including 840 family tents , 13 , 440 blankets , nearly 3 , 000 shelter kits and shelter fixing kits , 6 , 000 sleeping mats , and more than 3 , 000 dignity kits . A field hospital , provided through UK aid funding to UK - Med , arrived in Gaza from Manchester last Friday . This facility , staffed by UK and local medics , will be able to treat more than 100 patients a day . Along with Cyprus , the United States , the United Arab Emirates and others , Britain will help to deliver humanitarian aid by sea to a new temporary US military pier in Gaza via a maritime corridor from Cyprus . We have made it clear , however , that air and sea deliveries cannot be a substitute for the delivery of aid through land routes . Only through those routes can the demand for the volume of aid that is now required be met . We continue to press Israel to open more land crossings for longer , and with fewer screening requirements . There is no doubt that land crossings are the most effective means of getting aid into Gaza , and Israel must do more . There is also no doubt that the best way to bring an end to the suffering is to agree an immediate humanitarian pause , and progress towards a sustainable , permanent ceasefire without a return to destruction , fighting and loss of life .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-19.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-19.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2024-02-19.txt | debates2024-02-19_F4 | 2024-02-19 | UK", "debates2024-02-21.txt | debates2024-02-21_F6 | 2024-02-21 | UK", "debates2024-03-19.txt | debates2024-03-19_F23 | 2024-03-19 | UK", "debates2024-04-17.txt | debates2024-04-17_F19 | 2024-04-17 | UK", "debates2024-04-17.txt | debates2024-04-17_F20 | 2024-04-17 | UK", "debates2024-07-19.txt | debates2024-07-19_F18 | 2024-07-19 | UK", "debates2025-01-23.txt | debates2025-01-23_F11 | 2025-01-23 | UK", "debates2025-10-28.txt | debates2025-10-28_F12 | 2025-10-28 | UK"], "answer": "The speech dates are: 2024-02-19, 2024-02-21, 2024-03-19, 2024-04-17, 2024-07-19, 2025-01-23, 2025-10-28.

Member will agree to write a joint letter with me to his SNP colleagues in Holyrood asking , “ Where is the money ? ” We now come to SNP spokesperson . On behalf of myself and my colleagues , I ask the Minister to also convey our condolences to the Secretary of State . We were given assurances prior to Brexit that the structural funds that provide the capital funding for Scotland would be replaced by specific levelling - up and shared prosperity funding after Brexit . Can the Minister say how that funding from those sources compares to what it was prior to leaving the EU ? Four years since the United Kingdom left the EU , the UK Government have announced more than £1 . 4 billion for new levelling - up initiatives across Scotland . That exceeds the entire seven - year budget for the EU structural and investment funds for Scotland for 2014 to 2020 — roughly £780 million of funding — so I do not accept the analysis the hon .

I thank my hon . Friend for the update . Clearly , the most important thing right now is humanitarian aid , but there will be a requirement for long - term rebuilding of the structures that have been destroyed . The British people will want to be generous but , as my hon . Friend the Member for Bridgwater and West Somerset ( Mr Liddell - Grainger ) mentioned , there is a risk that funds will be diverted to improper uses . When a fund is set up to which the British people can contribute , will my hon . Friend make sure that the British people know how to contribute to it and that it goes to the people who need it ? My hon . Friend makes a good point , which has been reiterated by other Members : the money needs to get to the frontline . We will do everything we can , certainly with those funds provided by the UK Government and through the UN ; that will be a key focus . The fact that so many colleagues are raising the issue helps us to make that point with conviction . On his wider point , the primary focus right now is humanitarian need , but going forward , Libya needs to move down a pathway to free and fair elections . That will help the country in the longer term , but humanitarian aid and support is our key focus right now . I join colleagues in offering my condolences to all those who have lost loved ones in the devastation in Libya . In my constituency and in many other parts of the country there are strong Libyan diaspora communities watching on in despair , unsure about the whereabouts of their loved ones . Will the Minister confirm what support is available to Libyan communities and others in the UK to gain information about friends and family in Libya ? Our embassy staff are working closely with people on the ground , keeping in touch with what is going on , and our consular support team is keeping in touch with dual nationals in Libya , providing the support they need . They will continue to do that . Our condolences go not only to the people of Libya but to the wider diaspora as well . We will continue to do everything we can , as hon . Members on all sides of the House have urged — that message has been well received today . I fully support the fact that the UK Government have provided international assistance to the people of Libya , but what are we doing specifically to ensure humanitarian assistance is urgently getting to people on the ground today ? As I say , we have made our initial offer of support . We continue to have an active dialogue with the Libyan authorities and the UN . As I said to the Opposition spokesperson , the hon . Member for West Ham ( Ms Brown ) , the key thing today is that we are waiting for the UN needs assessment , so we can then give our best assessment of what sort of support we need to help to provide . The tragic scenes we are witnessing in Libya are utterly horrifying ; my thoughts and prayers are with all those affected . During the earthquakes in Syria and Turkey , my noble Friend Lord Purvis asked “ why the Government ’ s humanitarian crisis reserve , which recently stood at £500 million , has now been depleted to only £30 million , which means that the UK ’ s response to any other emergencies or disasters will be greatly reduced . ” — [ Official Report , House of Lords , 6 March 2023 ; Vol .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-09-14.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-09-14.txt"}, {"score": 0.6119658350944519, "chunk_id": "debates2024-01-30_F9", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-01-30.txt", "date": "2024-01-30", "parliament": "UK", "text": "What assessment he has made of the impact of the UK ’ s non - military support to Ukraine over winter 2023 - 24 on the humanitarian situation in that country .

What recent discussions he has had with his international counterparts on the war in Ukraine . Since February 2020 the UK has committed £357 million of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine . In response to winter we scaled up humanitarian support with additional funding to provide cash assistance , insulation , and support for energy and heating . The Foreign Secretary ’ s first overseas visit was to Ukraine . He continues to set out the UK ambition to international partners and did so in November during NATO and OSCE gatherings , and most recently at Davos , where he met Foreign Minister Kuleba . Tim Bamford , our local councillor for Denby Dale , has devoted his own time and expense to making several potentially dangerous excursions , driving a truck to deliver essential humanitarian aid to war - torn Ukraine alongside volunteers from the Yorkshire Aid Convoy . Will the Minister join me in thanking Tim — who is sitting in the Public Gallery — and all the fantastic team at the Yorkshire Aid Convoy for everything that they are doing to help the Ukrainian people , and wish them a safe journey for their next trip in March ? I am delighted to join my hon . Friend in thanking Tim and Tina Bamford , both of whom are in the Public Gallery . The response of the British people to the tragedy in Ukraine has been remarkable and hugely generous , and we salute the courage and generosity of spirit shown by the commendable actions of the Yorkshire Aid Convoy . There are many billions of Russian assets frozen by western nations , and there is a strong moral case for Ukraine to use those assets to repel Russia ’ s aggression and rebuild its own economy . What progress has the Department made in talking to other nations to make that a reality ? I agree that there is a strong moral case for using Russian assets to repair the damage that Russia has wrought on Ukraine . We are clear about the fact that Russia should pay , and we continue to assess what legal path there might be to achieving that end . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recently said : “ I think the big difference from last year to this year is that this year…There is somehow a trend towards getting used to Ukrainian suffering . ” It is more than 200 days since the Opposition tabled a motion necessitating Government legislation to bring about the full seizure and repurposing of Russian state assets within 90 days , but no plan has yet been forthcoming . Why are the Government so out of step with our allies and partners in this regard ? We are not out of step ; we are leading the pack , and have been doing so for the last two years . Our resolve is shown by our own financial commitment but also by our permanent commitment to the UK - Ukraine relationship , which was demonstrated when the Prime Minister signed the UK - Ukraine agreement on security co - operation at the start of the year . We are in it for the long haul . Tomorrow Jens Stoltenberg , the Secretary - General of NATO , will meet representatives of the Heritage Foundation , a Republican - leaning think - tank . He will meet allies of former President Trump in an effort to unlock $ 60 billion of funding for Ukraine .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-01-30.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-01-30.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2023-09-14.txt | debates2023-09-14_F20 | 2023-09-14 | UK", "debates2024-01-30.txt | debates2024-01-30_F9 | 2024-01-30 | UK", "debates2025-02-06.txt | debates2025-02-06_F23 | 2025-02-06 | UK", "debates2025-02-25.txt | debates2025-02-25_F14 | 2025-02-25 | UK", "debates2025-04-02.txt | debates2025-04-02_F33 | 2025-04-02 | UK"], "answer": "The speech dates are: 2023-09-14, 2024-01-30, 2025-02-06, 2025-02-25, 2025-04-02.

Lady ’ s questions . She asked about the turnaround times for UK aid getting into Gaza . Certainly we have seen a far speedier throughput , but I am sure that she would agree that we need to see commercial shipments of goods getting into Gaza ; that is necessary if there is to be delivery of food and other supplies on the scale that is required . We continue to push the Government of Israel to enable that to happen as quickly as possible . As for the metrics being used when it comes to the distribution of that aid , we are working closely with trusted partners , and as the right hon . Lady would expect , we continuously monitor the distribution of UK supplies . Much of our activity has been undertaken jointly with other countries , as well as with UN agencies , and we work closely with them to ensure that aid is delivered where it is needed . Lastly , the right hon . Lady asked whether there had been a change in types of aid . We need access for tents in particular , as well as other forms of shelter and medical supplies . When I was in Jordan , I saw medical supplies that it had not been possible to deliver to Gaza , and we need access for those . We have seen improvements in some areas , but given the scale of the challenge , we need to see further improvements , especially in relation to water and sanitation where there has been a great deal of destruction . Urgent action is needed to improve the position . rose — To those Members who were seven minutes late , please do not embarrass each other by standing . We have seen a really worrying escalation of violence on the west bank , just at the time when this fragile peace has been found in Gaza . Large parts of Jenin refugee camp have been completely destroyed by Israeli security forces , and thousands have been forcibly displaced . UNRWA services have been interrupted . What measures is the Minister taking to ensure that Palestinians can live safely and securely in their homes on the west bank ? I am grateful to my hon . Friend for raising this issue . She has considerable expertise in the area of humanitarian support , as do many other Members in the Chamber . As I said in my previous response , the UK is very concerned about the situation in Jenin , which we continue to monitor very carefully . We are clear that peace and stability on the west bank is in everyone ’ s interests — it is in the state of Israel ’ s interests , and in the interests of Palestinians . On 18 December , in a statement at the UN Security Council meeting on the Occupied Palestinian Territories , the UK called on Israel to stop illegal settlement expansion on Palestinian land , and we are considering all options for taking further action . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . President Trump ’ s proposals for the forced displacement of Gaza ’ s 2 . 2 million inhabitants would constitute a grave violation of international law , and threaten the fragile ceasefire and the return of the hostages . Will the Minister condemn them ? The Palestinian people have a right to self - determination and to a state of their own , as has been British policy for decades , so will the Government finally commit to an immediate recognition of a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders ?", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-02-06.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-02-06.txt"}, {"score": 0.6194782853126526, "chunk_id": "debates2023-09-14_F20", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-09-14.txt", "date": "2023-09-14", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Our funding through the UN is pivotal at this time . I thank my hon . Friend for the update . Clearly , the most important thing right now is humanitarian aid , but there will be a requirement for long - term rebuilding of the structures that have been destroyed . The British people will want to be generous but , as my hon . Friend the Member for Bridgwater and West Somerset ( Mr Liddell - Grainger ) mentioned , there is a risk that funds will be diverted to improper uses . When a fund is set up to which the British people can contribute , will my hon . Friend make sure that the British people know how to contribute to it and that it goes to the people who need it ? My hon . Friend makes a good point , which has been reiterated by other Members : the money needs to get to the frontline . We will do everything we can , certainly with those funds provided by the UK Government and through the UN ; that will be a key focus . The fact that so many colleagues are raising the issue helps us to make that point with conviction . On his wider point , the primary focus right now is humanitarian need , but going forward , Libya needs to move down a pathway to free and fair elections . That will help the country in the longer term , but humanitarian aid and support is our key focus right now . I join colleagues in offering my condolences to all those who have lost loved ones in the devastation in Libya . In my constituency and in many other parts of the country there are strong Libyan diaspora communities watching on in despair , unsure about the whereabouts of their loved ones . Will the Minister confirm what support is available to Libyan communities and others in the UK to gain information about friends and family in Libya ? Our embassy staff are working closely with people on the ground , keeping in touch with what is going on , and our consular support team is keeping in touch with dual nationals in Libya , providing the support they need . They will continue to do that . Our condolences go not only to the people of Libya but to the wider diaspora as well . We will continue to do everything we can , as hon . Members on all sides of the House have urged — that message has been well received today . I fully support the fact that the UK Government have provided international assistance to the people of Libya , but what are we doing specifically to ensure humanitarian assistance is urgently getting to people on the ground today ? As I say , we have made our initial offer of support . We continue to have an active dialogue with the Libyan authorities and the UN . As I said to the Opposition spokesperson , the hon . Member for West Ham ( Ms Brown ) , the key thing today is that we are waiting for the UN needs assessment , so we can then give our best assessment of what sort of support we need to help to provide . The tragic scenes we are witnessing in Libya are utterly horrifying ; my thoughts and prayers are with all those affected . During the earthquakes in Syria and Turkey , my noble Friend Lord Purvis asked “ why the Government ’ s humanitarian crisis reserve , which recently stood at £500 million , has now been depleted to only £30 million , which means that the UK ’ s response to any other emergencies or disasters will be greatly reduced . ” — [ Official Report , House of Lords , 6 March 2023 ; Vol .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-09-14.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-09-14.txt"}, {"score": 0.6119658350944519, "chunk_id": "debates2024-01-30_F9", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-01-30.txt", "date": "2024-01-30", "parliament": "UK", "text": "What assessment he has made of the impact of the UK ’ s non - military support to Ukraine over winter 2023 - 24 on the humanitarian situation in that country . What recent diplomatic support he has provided to Ukraine . What discussions he has had with his international counterparts on maintaining support for Ukraine . What recent discussions he has had with his international counterparts on the war in Ukraine . Since February 2020 the UK has committed £357 million of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine . In response to winter we scaled up humanitarian support with additional funding to provide cash assistance , insulation , and support for energy and heating . The Foreign Secretary ’ s first overseas visit was to Ukraine . He continues to set out the UK ambition to international partners and did so in November during NATO and OSCE gatherings , and most recently at Davos , where he met Foreign Minister Kuleba . Tim Bamford , our local councillor for Denby Dale , has devoted his own time and expense to making several potentially dangerous excursions , driving a truck to deliver essential humanitarian aid to war - torn Ukraine alongside volunteers from the Yorkshire Aid Convoy . Will the Minister join me in thanking Tim — who is sitting in the Public Gallery — and all the fantastic team at the Yorkshire Aid Convoy for everything that they are doing to help the Ukrainian people , and wish them a safe journey for their next trip in March ? I am delighted to join my hon . Friend in thanking Tim and Tina Bamford , both of whom are in the Public Gallery . The response of the British people to the tragedy in Ukraine has been remarkable and hugely generous , and we salute the courage and generosity of spirit shown by the commendable actions of the Yorkshire Aid Convoy . There are many billions of Russian assets frozen by western nations , and there is a strong moral case for Ukraine to use those assets to repel Russia ’ s aggression and rebuild its own economy . What progress has the Department made in talking to other nations to make that a reality ? I agree that there is a strong moral case for using Russian assets to repair the damage that Russia has wrought on Ukraine . We are clear about the fact that Russia should pay , and we continue to assess what legal path there might be to achieving that end . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recently said : “ I think the big difference from last year to this year is that this year…There is somehow a trend towards getting used to Ukrainian suffering . ” It is more than 200 days since the Opposition tabled a motion necessitating Government legislation to bring about the full seizure and repurposing of Russian state assets within 90 days , but no plan has yet been forthcoming . Why are the Government so out of step with our allies and partners in this regard ? We are not out of step ; we are leading the pack , and have been doing so for the last two years . Our resolve is shown by our own financial commitment but also by our permanent commitment to the UK - Ukraine relationship , which was demonstrated when the Prime Minister signed the UK - Ukraine agreement on security co - operation at the start of the year . We are in it for the long haul . Tomorrow Jens Stoltenberg , the Secretary - General of NATO , will meet representatives of the Heritage Foundation , a Republican - leaning think - tank . He will meet allies of former President Trump in an effort to unlock $ 60 billion of funding for Ukraine .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-01-30.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-01-30.txt"}, {"score": 0.6096222400665283, "chunk_id": "debates2024-07-19_F18", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-07-19.txt", "date": "2024-07-19", "parliament": "UK", "text": "As the right hon . Gentleman rightly set out , the situation in Gaza is desperate . Too many Palestinian civilians have been killed . We continue to see strikes on humanitarian infrastructure and the humanitarian situation is unforgivable . The index on famine states that Gaza is now in just that : full famine . I saw this when I went on my own visit to the Egyptian border with Gaza and met families who had had to be evacuated due to the severity of the harm caused to them . We need an immediate end to the fighting and to secure the release of the hostages , whose families continue to suffer unbearable torment on a daily basis , so will the right hon . Gentleman please provide an update to the House on reassurances he has received on the safety of the hostages ? On aid , in his meetings has the Foreign Secretary secured any reassurances to increase the number of trucks going into Gaza ? Seventy - odd a day is just not enough . In government , we did everything we could to urge Israel to let more humanitarian aid into Gaza and open more crossings , including through Rafah , and we trebled our own aid commitment within the last financial year , doing everything we could to get aid there by land , sea or air . We had success in getting the Ashdod port open , as well as Kerem Shalom , and helped get 11 airdrops into Gaza . The field hospital provided by UK aid funding to UK - Med has treated thousands of patients . We also supported and helped to set up a maritime aid corridor to Gaza . The right hon . Gentleman announced today the return of funding to UNRWA . Can he please advise the House on the timeline for that , and provide assurances that taxpayers ’ funding will be directed with due regard ? Only an end to the fighting will enable a significant scaling up of humanitarian aid . The right hon . Gentleman rightly stated that Biden set forward a proposal backed by Israel and the UN Security Council to end the hostilities . What action is he taking to move that proposal forward ? Can he also provide us with any reassurances he has secured in his meetings with Netanyahu ? He rightly raised the case of extremist settlers ; we were one of the first Governments to put in place sanctions against some of them . Can he assure us that he raised this issue with the Israeli Government , and whether more sanctions will be forthcoming ? The risk of escalation remains high , particularly with Hezbollah in Lebanon , so can I please ask whether his Department assesses any change in Iranian intent , activities or funding following the sham election of the Iranian President ? When they sat on the Opposition Benches , both the right hon . Gentleman and the now Home Secretary were crystal clear that , were they in government , they would proscribe the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , so can we please now have the timing for this proscription ? We all want to see an end to this devastating situation , which threatens the stability and security of so many . As His Majesty ’ s loyal Opposition , our priority will be to work with the Government , but also to challenge and scrutinise them as needed . Ultimately , we can assure the Government that we will always work in the national interest because it is foreign policy that keeps our people safe at home , and that is our foremost duty .

Support for Ukraine and for Gaza have survived the disastrous cuts to ODA , but what assessments has the Department made of the impact of ODA reductions on countries facing humanitarian and natural disasters , and can the UK still provide the amount of aid needed to prevent displacement and migration as a result of those crises ? The hon . Member raises important issues . We have seen horrific scenes in Afghanistan , and he will know that we gave £1 million yesterday . We have also seen terrible scenes in Sudan this morning . He will know that tackling the climate and nature emergency around the world is a priority for us , and we continue to support humanitarian work around the world . Of course , responding to disasters remains a key part of that , and we have demonstrated that repeatedly in a number of contexts , through the support that we have given . Could the Minister update the House on the reduction in assistance to places including Myanmar , and on democracy there , and the imprisonment of Daw Suu ? We have to make very difficult choices as a result of the decision we made . We remain absolutely committed to international development . The detailed allocations will be set out in due course , and they will of course be informed by impact assessments before we publish multi - year allocations . I call the shadow Minister . At a time when we face global development spending reductions across critical areas such as global health , women , peace and security , girls ’ education , water , sanitation and hygiene , and nutrition , Ministers have chosen to increase energy and climate spending by £244 million — an increase of 59 % . Could the Minister explain the rationale for that significant increase and outline how those funds will be allocated , particularly as , unlike in 2024 - 25 , no breakdown of political priorities is available for scrutiny ? As I have just said , we will set out the detailed allocations in due course ; they will be informed by impact assessments . The right hon . Member rightly raises the issue of women and girls . Of course , less money does not mean less action , and we see our work on women and girls as essential for development and our UK missions overseas . We have appointed Baroness Harman as a UK special envoy for women and girls . We are amplifying the voices of women ’ s organisations and movements , including in climate - affected contexts , and embedding gender equality across our international action .

Gentleman is right to say that a ceasefire is essential , with troops returning to barracks and the opening up of a political track , and that is the central thrust of the British Government ’ s policy . He acknowledges that we have managed nearly to double aid to £89 million this year . For South Sudan — this , of course , also addresses many of the problems of Sudan — the figure for this financial year is £111 million , which is more than double what it was . That includes multilateral and bilateral spend . The fact that Britain has doubled its contribution gives it a locus , which was well used by my noble friend Lord Benyon last week in Paris at the Sudan conference , to make the point about other countries also supporting , given the desperate plight in which so many in Sudan find themselves . I welcome this urgent question and the Government ’ s response . We regularly talk about what is going on in Ukraine and the middle east , but we do not focus on the continent of Africa , or Sudan , which is turning into a failed state . There is every prospect of what is going on in Sudan spilling out into other parts of central Africa and the Sahel . Will the Deputy Foreign Secretary update the House on whether we have any presence in Port Sudan ? He talks about peace talks . Egypt has also engaged in those , so can he update the House on the prospect of what is happening bringing the necessary parties together ? In respect of my right hon . Friend ’ s final point , we are hopeful that the third set of negotiations in Jeddah will take place . The Saudis committed on 15 April to that happening in early May , and we are extremely grateful to the Saudis for that and for inviting the UAE , Egypt , the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development to be part of the negotiations . The former Chairman of the Defence Committee is right about the danger of contagion across the region . We are doing everything we can to support Abdalla Hamdok and the Taqaddum , as I mentioned earlier . In terms of our support within Sudan , the ambassador is currently based in Addis Ababa and is working energetically with all the relevant parties to try to make progress . The Sudanese community in Liverpool , Riverside , will be decidedly underwhelmed by the Minister ’ s response to this urgent question . He mentioned supporting people moving to neighbouring areas , but he did not mention the Sudanese who have lived , worked and contributed for years to the UK bringing over family members who are fleeing the conflict , or extending student visas or protections for Sudanese asylum seekers . What will it take for the UK to provide a visa programme for Sudanese asylum seekers , similar to the Ukrainian scheme ? The two situations are not analogous . If the Labour party wants to launch a campaign for extra visas and a special scheme matching the one in Ukraine , I look forward to hearing details of it . My wife and I spent a wonderful holiday in Sudan a few years ago , and it was wonderful to see the amazing people there , as well as the rich cultural heritage that Sudan has to offer . There are many world heritage sites , such as the pyramids of Meroë — there are more pyramids in Sudan than Egypt — ancient cathedrals , and even Lord Kitchener ’ s boat . We hear that fighting has spread to some of the world heritage areas .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-22.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-22.txt"}, {"score": 39.7945203072026, "chunk_id": "debates2025-07-16_F26", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-07-16.txt", "date": "2025-07-16", "parliament": "UK", "text": "The UN Security Council is not just about military intervention , in terms of the security ; as the right hon . Gentleman is aware , it is also about the impact of the diplomatic solutions . As the penholder , the UK has the most important role to try to bring everybody together around the table , which is why we had the London Sudan conference . There were some who threw their hands up and said , “ We haven ’ t achieved anything , ” but I think the important thing was that we laid down a marker , and that we are now following up with other partners and being seen as leaders in the area . It is by using the UN Security Council leadership role that we will eventually get to a solution . However , the right hon . Gentleman is quite right to say that there are a lot of fingers in the pie . What is happening in Sudan — in Darfur , in particular — is one of the world ’ s deepest and longest - running humanitarian crises . Unfortunately , we are seeing rising tensions and military action in neighbouring South Sudan , particularly in the Upper Nile region . The Ugandan army has recently entered South Sudan , and there is a real risk of regional conflict and civil war , which would create a much deeper humanitarian crisis across the whole region . What is the UK doing to de - escalate that potential conflict , such as talking to Uganda and South Sudan ? My hon . Friend is quite right to say that the longer the war lasts , the greater its ripple effect . We should give credit to countries like Egypt , Chad and South Sudan , alongside others nearby , for managing this crisis and for taking so many people in . There has also been aid from countries like the UK , but the impact within the region is devastating . I will certainly take back to the Minister for Africa my hon . Friend ’ s point about the impact on South Sudan and reply in writing with what we are going to do this month — not waiting until September , as my hon . Friend the Member for Stratford and Bow ( Uma Kumaran ) said . As a former aid worker and resident of Darfur , I feel deeply for the people of Sudan . Will the Minister say whether there are plans to increase the amount of spend for the emergency response rooms ? They are clearly doing very valuable work at the moment . I thank the hon . Gentleman for all the work he did before coming to Parliament and his important support for so many countries ; I have been in debates with him on Myanmar and others . It is important that we lay on the record that £120 million is a lot of money , and that we have to follow that money . As I explained before , de - banking sometimes occurs in certain contexts , which is why we need to have those relationships on the ground with the sorts of aid organisations that my hon . Friend the Member for Stratford and Bow spoke about , covering the situation as it is today and how to maintain those relationships . My personal view is that it is not always just about the impact of the budget ; sometimes it is about the diplomatic work that goes on around the funding so that we can maximise that money . The brutal violence being perpetrated against Sudanese civilians is only fuelled by external actors from the UAE , Egypt , Russia and beyond .

I thank you , Mr Speaker , for granting this urgent question , but I regret that in the past seven months there has been only one statement on Sudan from the Government . Local and community - led emergency response rooms are central to the on - the - ground response . Will the Minister outline how the UK is increasing support to those ERRs ? Since the London conference , what bilateral conversations have the Government had with regional actors and the US about Sudan ? War crimes are being committed on an almost daily basis . The two principal warring parties oppose a democratic Sudan , so what are the Government doing to support Sudanese civilian groups and civil society fighting for the democratic future ? Since 2023 , The New York Times has repeatedly reported that the United Arab Emirates is funnelling weapons to the Rapid Support Forces , and the UN ’ s expert panel on Sudan deemed those allegations credible . What are the Government doing to address the proliferation of outside weapons in Sudan , and to uphold and expand the arms embargo ? How are they clamping down on the illicit international trade in Sudanese gold , which is financing this war ? Finally , what assessment have the Government made of the American judgment that chemical weapons are being used in Sudan ? The hon . Lady quite rightly pushes us to say more in this House . There have been lots of questions from Members when the Foreign Secretary has been answering broader questions , such as on G7 or NATO meetings , so Members across the House have asked questions under the umbrella of international affairs and the Foreign Secretary has replied to them , but we can always do more . As the hon . Lady is aware , we need to keep up the momentum from the London Sudan conference . She asks who we are working with . We are of course working with the African Union . This is , first and foremost , a question of promoting leadership of African countries to deal with issues in Africa . The Foreign Secretary has redoubled his efforts as a well - respected Foreign Secretary within the African Union dialogues , and recently joined the EU - convened consultative group on Sudan in June , which I know the hon . Lady will appreciate and think is a worthwhile forum for us to be in . As mentioned , the friends of Sudan group in Geneva will also advance the work to protect civilians . The hon . Lady mentions the UAE . Our message to any partners who may have an element of involvement in the conflict is clear : we need to press for a peaceful solution .

What recent discussions he has had with the independent adviser on ministers ’ interests on ensuring transparency of declarations . There is an established process in place for the declaration and management of interests held by Ministers , as set out in the ministerial code . The independent adviser on ministers ’ interests publishes a twice - yearly list of Ministers ’ interests . Since 2023 , interim updates to the list are also issued as needed . The latest list was published in December . Public appointment declarations are important . As the public face of scandal - ridden Greensill Capital , it has been said of Lord Cameron that he earned $ 10 million , was paid via an offshore trust and enjoyed many personal flights on Greensill ’ s planes . Yet when challenged on his remunerations , Lord Cameron refused to answer , saying that he had been a private citizen and had declared all the information for the Register of Members ’ Financial Interests . The reply that I received from the independent adviser about all that said that , on appointment , Ministers must declare their private interests . I ask the Minister how a Member can get answers to questions about Lord Cameron ’ s employment before his appointment . Surely , if someone gets a new public job , answers to fair questions should be laid out for us all to see ? As the hon . Member says , integrity is vital in this place and we all adhere to high standards . He will also know that there is an established regime in place for those declarations . The Foreign Secretary has adhered to those and , as he has said , he has just one job now , Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom . He is very proud to have that job and to work with the Prime Minister to try to make sure our country is as safe and prosperous as possible . I call the SNP spokesperson . Thank you , Mr Speaker . Please accept my apologies if my voice gives out part - way through my question ; I will do my best . Our thoughts in the SNP are with Tony Lloyd ’ s family , his constituents and all those feeling the pain of his loss today .

The most important things the UK can do to build on the momentum of the important London Sudan conference — bearing in mind that we were the first to have such a conference — are to continue to base our work on the statement from its co - chairs ; to continue , as she says , to use our role at the United Nations ; and to work through the new friends of Sudan grouping to keep pushing at the highest level , using our position on the UN Security Council to galvanise its action and continue the important supply of aid into the region . I call the shadow Minister . I am grateful to you , Mr Speaker , for granting this urgent question , and my right hon . Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield ( Sir Andrew Mitchell ) for pursuing this matter . The situation in Sudan is dire . We are deeply concerned by the International Criminal Court ’ s findings last week that there are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity may be being committed in Darfur . The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate , with the UN warning on 30 June of drastic cuts to life - saving food aid for Sudanese refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries . Sudan has been identified as the global hunger hotspot of highest concern , and without immediate humanitarian assistance , the risk is terrible . With recent attacks on UN aid convoys , can the Minister provide her latest assessment of the situation and the extent of aid blocking ? How is she ensuring that UK aid — including the £120 million announced at the April Sudan conference — will reach those who need it , and that aid workers are protected ? More broadly , what new measures are the Government taking to compel the warring parties into a ceasefire , to allow more aid in and to facilitate deconfliction for its delivery in the meantime ? How has the Minister supported Sudanese civilian and political forces to engage in constructive dialogue processes such as the Cairo conference , and what is her assessment of the effectiveness of these processes ? Despite the spending review , we are yet to understand what the 0 . 3 % figure means for bilateral aid , so will she confirm the bilateral spend for Sudan this year ? Sudan matters . It is not in the UK ’ s national interests for the crossing of red lines in this conflict to persist , to have the displacement of people on this scale , nor to see the further destabilisation of this region of Africa . The right hon . Lady asked about the last week ’ s ICC finding . We acknowledge the ICC Office of the Prosecutor ’ s critical findings that there are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have well been committed , and are continuing to be committed , in Darfur . This is an important milestone in the ICC ’ s investigation into crimes committed in Darfur , and the UK remains steadfast in its commitment to ensure that international humanitarian law is respected and breaches are called out and investigated . The UK remains committed to securing accountability for those responsible for atrocity crimes . This includes reporting the fact - finding mission ’ s mandate and the ICC ’ s ongoing investigation . The right hon . Lady mentioned the attack on El Fasher and the targeting of aid workers . That is an absolute disgrace and a clear violation of international law , and we condemn it .

Last year alone , we sanctioned 18 criminals responsible for spreading a prolific ransomware strain , and we exposed the Russian intelligence services for their attempts to target high - profile individuals and entities through cyber - operations . I thank the Secretary of State for his response . In the wake of the recent attack on the British Library , will he tell us what assessment the Government have made of potential cyber - attacks on other non - departmental public bodies ? How will he ensure that they are not vulnerable to similar attacks and that the country is not brought to a standstill ? The hon . Lady is absolutely right to highlight that attack . It demonstrates that such attacks can affect not just central Government ; any agency of government can be subject to them . Indeed , we discussed it at Cabinet just this week . I continue to co - ordinate activity through the ministerial cyber board , and the National Cyber Security Centre works closely with Government agencies , including the British Library , to ensure that they are as robustly prepared as they can be . What recent discussions he has had with the independent adviser on ministers ’ interests on ensuring transparency of declarations . There is an established process in place for the declaration and management of interests held by Ministers , as set out in the ministerial code . The independent adviser on ministers ’ interests publishes a twice - yearly list of Ministers ’ interests . Since 2023 , interim updates to the list are also issued as needed . The latest list was published in December . Public appointment declarations are important . As the public face of scandal - ridden Greensill Capital , it has been said of Lord Cameron that he earned $ 10 million , was paid via an offshore trust and enjoyed many personal flights on Greensill ’ s planes . Yet when challenged on his remunerations , Lord Cameron refused to answer , saying that he had been a private citizen and had declared all the information for the Register of Members ’ Financial Interests . The reply that I received from the independent adviser about all that said that , on appointment , Ministers must declare their private interests . I ask the Minister how a Member can get answers to questions about Lord Cameron ’ s employment before his appointment . Surely , if someone gets a new public job , answers to fair questions should be laid out for us all to see ? As the hon . Member says , integrity is vital in this place and we all adhere to high standards . He will also know that there is an established regime in place for those declarations . The Foreign Secretary has adhered to those and , as he has said , he has just one job now , Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom . He is very proud to have that job and to work with the Prime Minister to try to make sure our country is as safe and prosperous as possible . I call the SNP spokesperson . Thank you , Mr Speaker . Please accept my apologies if my voice gives out part - way through my question ; I will do my best . Our thoughts in the SNP are with Tony Lloyd ’ s family , his constituents and all those feeling the pain of his loss today . The Prime Minister and four Ministers , including the Foreign Secretary , hold their wealth in blind trusts or managements . The “ Ministerial Code ” says : “ Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises , or appears to arise , between their public duties and their private interests ” .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-01-18.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-01-18.txt"}, {"score": 38.436841292184646, "chunk_id": "debates2025-07-16_F21", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-07-16.txt", "date": "2025-07-16", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Friend , who is a loud voice here on behalf her Sudanese diaspora . The most important things the UK can do to build on the momentum of the important London Sudan conference — bearing in mind that we were the first to have such a conference — are to continue to base our work on the statement from its co - chairs ; to continue , as she says , to use our role at the United Nations ; and to work through the new friends of Sudan grouping to keep pushing at the highest level , using our position on the UN Security Council to galvanise its action and continue the important supply of aid into the region . I call the shadow Minister . I am grateful to you , Mr Speaker , for granting this urgent question , and my right hon . Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield ( Sir Andrew Mitchell ) for pursuing this matter . The situation in Sudan is dire . We are deeply concerned by the International Criminal Court ’ s findings last week that there are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity may be being committed in Darfur . The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate , with the UN warning on 30 June of drastic cuts to life - saving food aid for Sudanese refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries . Sudan has been identified as the global hunger hotspot of highest concern , and without immediate humanitarian assistance , the risk is terrible . With recent attacks on UN aid convoys , can the Minister provide her latest assessment of the situation and the extent of aid blocking ? How is she ensuring that UK aid — including the £120 million announced at the April Sudan conference — will reach those who need it , and that aid workers are protected ? More broadly , what new measures are the Government taking to compel the warring parties into a ceasefire , to allow more aid in and to facilitate deconfliction for its delivery in the meantime ? How has the Minister supported Sudanese civilian and political forces to engage in constructive dialogue processes such as the Cairo conference , and what is her assessment of the effectiveness of these processes ? Despite the spending review , we are yet to understand what the 0 . 3 % figure means for bilateral aid , so will she confirm the bilateral spend for Sudan this year ? Sudan matters . It is not in the UK ’ s national interests for the crossing of red lines in this conflict to persist , to have the displacement of people on this scale , nor to see the further destabilisation of this region of Africa . The right hon . Lady asked about the last week ’ s ICC finding . We acknowledge the ICC Office of the Prosecutor ’ s critical findings that there are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have well been committed , and are continuing to be committed , in Darfur . This is an important milestone in the ICC ’ s investigation into crimes committed in Darfur , and the UK remains steadfast in its commitment to ensure that international humanitarian law is respected and breaches are called out and investigated . The UK remains committed to securing accountability for those responsible for atrocity crimes . This includes reporting the fact - finding mission ’ s mandate and the ICC ’ s ongoing investigation . The right hon . Lady mentioned the attack on El Fasher and the targeting of aid workers . That is an absolute disgrace and a clear violation of international law , and we condemn it . She asked what more we have been doing recently .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-07-16.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-07-16.txt"}, {"score": 38.35900031134998, "chunk_id": "debates2025-01-14_F4", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-01-14.txt", "date": "2025-01-14", "parliament": "UK", "text": "The UK has doubled its aid to Sudan . We have sought to use the UN Security Council , as I mentioned . We ensured through the Foreign Secretary that there was a Sudan session with G7 and Arab Quint Foreign Ministers , and the UK special representative to Sudan has visited Sudan ; that occurred in December for the first time since the conflict . I welcome what the right hon . Lady said yesterday , but the delivery of aid is clearly being used as a weapon in this conflict . What steps are being taken to ensure that the aid gets through to the people most in need on the ground in Sudan ? I am grateful to the right hon . Gentleman for raising that . I know he shares our deep concern about the impact of restrictions on aid , which we have particularly seen feeding through into the famine assessment from the IPC — integrated food security phase classification — that came out at the end of last year . There must be , above all , a permanent opening of crossings . We were , of course , pleased to see the Adre crossing open for three months , but it must be opened permanently . We also need to see cross - line availability of aid . We need to have the warring parties focused on humanitarian need , not on pursuing a war that they both appear to think they can win but as a result of which civilians are suffering appallingly . Following on from the question from the right hon . Member for Dumfriesshire , Clydesdale and Tweeddale ( David Mundell ) , I welcome the Government ’ s ongoing support for the humanitarian effort in Sudan and the wider region , but does the Minister share my concern that aid risks not reaching those who need it most ? Will she continue to put pressure on Sudan for the Adre crossing to be kept open permanently , so that vital aid can get to those who need it most ? Could she update the House on what steps she is taking in that area ? I am grateful to my hon . Friend for being so clear about the challenges around aid coming into Sudan and then being delivered to those who so desperately need it . We will keep pushing on the need for the Adre crossing to remain open . We will also keep pushing on the need for aid workers to be protected within Sudan and for UN staff to be able to access Sudan . Of course , we will work with those on the ground , particularly the emergency response rooms , which are delivering essential mutual aid . What steps he is taking with international partners to help increase UK economic growth . The UK and India ’ s Prime Ministers have committed to an ambitious refresh of the comprehensive strategic partnership . They announced that the UK - India trade talks will relaunch , which will deliver our joint ambition to take the UK - India relationship to even greater heights , and India is one of a handful of countries that will determine whether we meet the global warming limit of 1 . 5° C . This is indeed an exciting year to help improve our economic growth and our trading relationship with India . We are two nations with an intertwined history and common democratic ideals , and we face the risks of a dangerous world and a warming planet . I co - chair the India all - party parliamentary group , and one of my priorities is to strengthen our economic and strategic relationship .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-01-14.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-01-14.txt"}, {"score": 38.14966254919352, "chunk_id": "debates2025-07-16_F25", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-07-16.txt", "date": "2025-07-16", "parliament": "UK", "text": "My hon . Friend is a doughty campaigner on behalf of her constituents in Westminster and the City . I encourage her and her staff to use the MP hotline , because that is the best way of getting through in order to get consular advice and to reassure our communities in the diaspora of Sudan . I thank my right hon . Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield ( Sir Andrew Mitchell ) for securing this urgent question on the world ’ s worst humanitarian crisis . I welcome the leadership steps that the UK Government are taking , but will the Minister tell the House what conversations are being had with both the African Union and the United Nations about the possibility of surging peacekeepers into Sudan to protect civilians ? I thank the hon . Lady for her leadership role in the previous Parliament as the chair of the all - party parliamentary group on Sudan and South Sudan and as International Development Minister . There are a number of partners ; she has mentioned some of them . The participants at the London Sudan conference included Egypt , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , the UAE , Qatar , South Sudan , Chad , Kenya , Ethiopia and Uganda , and of course the like - mindeds : Norway , Canada , the USA and Switzerland . It was a perfect moment and the hon . Lady asks how we can continue that . We will redouble our efforts to work with the multilaterals such as the UN and the League of Arab States . There is quite a lot on their agenda at the moment , but it is very important that Sudan is not brought down the agenda just because it is in Africa . That is a fear , which is why it is so good to see the reporting in the Financial Times , The Guardian , and many of our other mainstream newspapers , to keep it in the spotlight . We will ensure that we work bilaterally with the countries we work with in normal times , and on a multilateral level to maintain our leadership role . The humanitarian situation in Sudan is horrific , with the growing perpetration of atrocity crimes against civilians . This is part of a growing pattern of mass atrocity crimes being perpetrated across the world , but the UK Government ’ s strategy on prevention of and response to mass atrocity crimes has not been updated since 2019 . Does the Minister agree that it is time for a fresh approach to this vital issue ? My hon . Friend knows of what she speaks , with her role before she came to this place . I shall take that as an action from today ’ s dialogue . Will the Minister explain to the House what , in practical terms , the Security Council could do , even if all its members were neutral on the question of backing one side over the other ? If two sides are determined to fight one another and neither is dependent on outside military assistance to pursue the conflict , is there anything practical that the Security Council could do , even if it was united and in agreement on the need for an intervention ? The UN Security Council is not just about military intervention , in terms of the security ; as the right hon . Gentleman is aware , it is also about the impact of the diplomatic solutions . As the penholder , the UK has the most important role to try to bring everybody together around the table , which is why we had the London Sudan conference .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-07-16.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-07-16.txt"}, {"score": 36.822163147972034, "chunk_id": "debates2025-10-28_F0", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-10-28.txt", "date": "2025-10-28", "parliament": "UK", "text": "[Document date: 2025-10-28]\nBefore we come to today ’ s business , I wanted to note that on Sunday 27 October , we marked the 75th anniversary of the rebuilding of this Chamber after it was bombed during the second world war and left destroyed . The Chamber we sit in today remains a continuing symbol of resilience and renewal . On the rebuilding of the Chamber , Prime Minister Winston Churchill described the House of Commons as “ the citadel of British liberty ” . This House and this Chamber continue to play a vital role at the heart of our democracy today . I am sure the whole House will want to join me in marking this important anniversary . I invite Members , at 11 am tomorrow , to attend the Chamber for a commemorative photo to mark the occasion . The Secretary of State was asked — What recent discussions she has had with her counterpart in the United Arab Emirates on the situation in Sudan . I join you , Mr Speaker , in marking the 75th anniversary of the rebuilding of this Chamber and the tribute to democracy . I know many people will have concerns for family and friends in Jamaica in the face of Hurricane Melissa , and I will make a further statement on the UK ’ s response during topical questions . On Sudan , I strongly condemn the escalating violence in El Fasher and the very grave reports of civilian casualties and suffering . It is estimated that between 200 and 300 civilians are in the city , at grave risk of atrocities , following the advance of the Rapid Support Forces . I have held meetings and discussions , including at the UN General Assembly , and since then with a series of countries including the United Arab Emirates and members of the Quad as we call for a desperately needed ceasefire . It has been widely reported in the press that the United Arab Emirates is arming the RSF in Sudan . The RSF is one of the two warring factions in Sudan , and it was found by the UN to be responsible for crimes against humanity including murder , torture , enslavement , rape and sexual violence . As per UK Government export data , the UK exported nearly £750 million - worth of arms to the UAE via standard individual export licences between 2019 and 2023 . If the UAE is indeed arming the RSF , the UK is breaching its arms export licensing criteria , specifically criteria 1f , 2 , 4 , 6 and 7 . Importantly , those criteria look beyond considering whether UK - exported weapons ultimately reached Sudan , and they instead consider the UK ’ s international obligations . Given this , what steps have the UK Government taken to verify whether the UAE is arming the RSF — Order . This is a very important subject , and other Members need to come in as well . These are meant to be questions , rather than statements . I recognise the importance of this matter , and I am sure you are going to come to the end of your question now . My apologies , Mr Speaker . Will the UK cease all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proven that the UAE is not arming the RSF ? Let me make two points in response to the hon . Gentleman ’ s question . First , as he will know , the UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports , including to prevent any diversion . That remains important , and we will continue to take that immensely seriously . Secondly , we need all countries with influence in the region to push the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces to ensure the protection of civilians .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-10-28.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-10-28.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2024-01-18.txt | debates2024-01-18_F7 | 2024-01-18 | UK", "debates2024-04-22.txt | debates2024-04-22_F23 | 2024-04-22 | UK", "debates2025-01-14.txt | debates2025-01-14_F4 | 2025-01-14 | UK", "debates2025-07-16.txt | debates2025-07-16_F21 | 2025-07-16 | UK", "debates2025-07-16.txt | debates2025-07-16_F23 | 2025-07-16 | UK", "debates2025-07-16.txt | debates2025-07-16_F25 | 2025-07-16 | UK", "debates2025-07-16.txt | debates2025-07-16_F26 | 2025-07-16 | UK", "debates2025-10-28.txt | debates2025-10-28_F0 | 2025-10-28 | UK"], "answer": "Several government departments and ministers have been involved in managing the response to the Sudan crisis based on the documents provided:\n\n1.

The Foreign Secretary and I continue to urge the Israeli authorities to address the famine and the catastrophic humanitarian situation immediately . More than 20 , 000 Palestinian children have been hospitalised for acute malnutrition this year alone . Amnesty International has condemned Israel ’ s use of starvation as a “ weapon of war ” , and the UN deputy relief chief has called the aid blockade a “ human - made crisis ” .

I share many of my constituents ’ despair and anger about the intolerable suffering in Gaza . Last year , I had the privilege of meeting one of my constituents , Becky , to hear about her heartbreaking experience of delivering medical aid in Palestine . Devastatingly , a year on , the situation is much worse , with Gaza now the child amputee capital of the world and thousands more families pushed to starvation . There have been some welcome moves from the Government in recent months , but clearly not enough has yet been done — nothing can be until the suffering has stopped . What further urgent action can we take to finally secure access to the aid that Gaza desperately needs , and end this intolerable suffering ? I thank my hon . Friend and his constituent , Becky . Over the recess , I met doctors who have served in Gaza . Hearing their first - hand accounts of the injuries that children are suffering there was truly horrifying .

We continue to call on the warring parties to place the interests of the Sudanese people over their pursuit of a military victory . The UK is working with our international partners to push the warring parties to return to the negotiating table and commit to a meaningful , sustainable ceasefire . Any process that follows must be inclusive . We underline the importance of a return to civilian rule that is democratic and representative of the whole country . Moves by the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces to establish their own parallel Governments will only exacerbate de facto splits , and could lead to the permanent partition of Sudan . That is in no one ’ s interests . We will continue to use all diplomatic tools at our disposal to protect civilians , get aid to those who need it most , and support a Sudanese - led peace process with civilians at its heart . Thank you very much , Mr Speaker , for granting this urgent question today . I make no apologies for raising the dire and desperate straits of the Sudanese people again in this House , not least because Britain leads on the Sudanese situation at the United Nations on behalf of all other nations . As the Minister said , the people of Sudan are in the throes of the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world and the situation is worsening , even if such things can hardly be imagined . Earlier this month , the United Nations and international organisations reported the mass displacement of tens of thousands of people following the combatant forces advancing across the Kordofan states . There have been months of increased mobilisation of fighters , including the recruitment of children from across Darfur . As fighting expands , the Kordofan states are the next deadly front . In the recent and welcome ministerial conference hosted by the Foreign Secretary , much - needed money was raised , but the goal of a high - level contact group to drive political efforts towards achieving a ceasefire and protecting Sudanese civilians met with an impasse . We must accept that despite our efforts the past two years have been a story of faltering international endeavour where world events have cast Sudan into the shadows as its people have faced only deepening peril . I ask the Minister three questions . First , what lessons have the Government learned from the siege of El Fasher and the overwhelming of the camp for displaced people at Zamzam to prepare for and protect civilians from the spread of violence across the Kordofan states ? How are the Government supporting the local emergency response rooms ? Secondly , can she confirm that the prevention of atrocities remains a key pillar of British policy and is unaffected by the recent cuts in the development budget ? Thirdly , and finally , what are the Government doing to advance international efforts to protect civilians alongside their pursuit of a ceasefire ? Are we to assume the Jeddah process is dead ? What discussions has she had with her counterparts in the United States over recent weeks ? I thank the right hon . Member for Sutton Coldfield ( Sir Andrew Mitchell ) for his questions and his long - standing interest not just in Africa in general , but particularly in this awful conflict in Sudan . Of course , Sudan is also a personal priority for the Foreign Secretary , which is why he brought together Foreign Ministers to try to find a resolution .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-07-16.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-07-16.txt"}, {"score": 0.6276980638504028, "chunk_id": "debates2025-02-25_F12", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-02-25.txt", "date": "2025-02-25", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Ending the conflict in Sudan is a personal priority for me . I recently visited the Adré border with the Chadian Foreign Minister to increase international attention on Sudan , and to meet Sudanese civilians who are bearing the brunt of this crisis . I am happy to announce that I will convene Foreign Ministers in London in April , around the second anniversary of the outbreak of the civil war in Sudan , to foster international consensus on a path to ending the conflict . I thank the Foreign Secretary for all that he is doing . As in so many conflicts , the discourse about this brutal Sudanese war is being fuelled by external actors with economic and mineral interests in Sudan , and with interests in wider geopolitical agitation , such as Russia ; Egypt , with its support for the Sudanese Armed Forces ; and the UAE , with its support for the Rapid Support Forces . There is also the wider user of mercenaries . What further steps can the Foreign Secretary take to use our leverage , not least our trading leverage , to ensure that actors are not fuelling this horrendous war and humanitarian crisis ? My hon . Friend will be pleased to hear that I raised these issues in my contribution at the G20 .

Over the recess , I met doctors who have served in Gaza . Hearing their first - hand accounts of the injuries that children are suffering there was truly horrifying .

As the Minister said , the people of Sudan are in the throes of the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world and the situation is worsening , even if such things can hardly be imagined . Earlier this month , the United Nations and international organisations reported the mass displacement of tens of thousands of people following the combatant forces advancing across the Kordofan states . There have been months of increased mobilisation of fighters , including the recruitment of children from across Darfur . As fighting expands , the Kordofan states are the next deadly front .

First , what lessons have the Government learned from the siege of El Fasher and the overwhelming of the camp for displaced people at Zamzam to prepare for and protect civilians from the spread of violence across the Kordofan states ? How are the Government supporting the local emergency response rooms ? Secondly , can she confirm that the prevention of atrocities remains a key pillar of British policy and is unaffected by the recent cuts in the development budget ? Thirdly , and finally , what are the Government doing to advance international efforts to protect civilians alongside their pursuit of a ceasefire ? Are we to assume the Jeddah process is dead ?

I welcome the leadership steps that the UK Government are taking , but will the Minister tell the House what conversations are being had with both the African Union and the United Nations about the possibility of surging peacekeepers into Sudan to protect civilians ? I thank the hon . Lady for her leadership role in the previous Parliament as the chair of the all - party parliamentary group on Sudan and South Sudan and as International Development Minister . There are a number of partners ; she has mentioned some of them . The participants at the London Sudan conference included Egypt , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , the UAE , Qatar , South Sudan , Chad , Kenya , Ethiopia and Uganda , and of course the like - mindeds : Norway , Canada , the USA and Switzerland . It was a perfect moment and the hon . Lady asks how we can continue that . We will redouble our efforts to work with the multilaterals such as the UN and the League of Arab States . There is quite a lot on their agenda at the moment , but it is very important that Sudan is not brought down the agenda just because it is in Africa . That is a fear , which is why it is so good to see the reporting in the Financial Times , The Guardian , and many of our other mainstream newspapers , to keep it in the spotlight . We will ensure that we work bilaterally with the countries we work with in normal times , and on a multilateral level to maintain our leadership role . The humanitarian situation in Sudan is horrific , with the growing perpetration of atrocity crimes against civilians . This is part of a growing pattern of mass atrocity crimes being perpetrated across the world , but the UK Government ’ s strategy on prevention of and response to mass atrocity crimes has not been updated since 2019 . Does the Minister agree that it is time for a fresh approach to this vital issue ? My hon . Friend knows of what she speaks , with her role before she came to this place . I shall take that as an action from today ’ s dialogue . Will the Minister explain to the House what , in practical terms , the Security Council could do , even if all its members were neutral on the question of backing one side over the other ? If two sides are determined to fight one another and neither is dependent on outside military assistance to pursue the conflict , is there anything practical that the Security Council could do , even if it was united and in agreement on the need for an intervention ? The UN Security Council is not just about military intervention , in terms of the security ; as the right hon . Gentleman is aware , it is also about the impact of the diplomatic solutions .

The most important things the UK can do to build on the momentum of the important London Sudan conference — bearing in mind that we were the first to have such a conference — are to continue to base our work on the statement from its co - chairs ; to continue , as she says , to use our role at the United Nations ; and to work through the new friends of Sudan grouping to keep pushing at the highest level , using our position on the UN Security Council to galvanise its action and continue the important supply of aid into the region . I call the shadow Minister . I am grateful to you , Mr Speaker , for granting this urgent question , and my right hon . Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield ( Sir Andrew Mitchell ) for pursuing this matter . The situation in Sudan is dire . We are deeply concerned by the International Criminal Court ’ s findings last week that there are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity may be being committed in Darfur . The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate , with the UN warning on 30 June of drastic cuts to life - saving food aid for Sudanese refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries . Sudan has been identified as the global hunger hotspot of highest concern , and without immediate humanitarian assistance , the risk is terrible . With recent attacks on UN aid convoys , can the Minister provide her latest assessment of the situation and the extent of aid blocking ? How is she ensuring that UK aid — including the £120 million announced at the April Sudan conference — will reach those who need it , and that aid workers are protected ? More broadly , what new measures are the Government taking to compel the warring parties into a ceasefire , to allow more aid in and to facilitate deconfliction for its delivery in the meantime ? How has the Minister supported Sudanese civilian and political forces to engage in constructive dialogue processes such as the Cairo conference , and what is her assessment of the effectiveness of these processes ? Despite the spending review , we are yet to understand what the 0 . 3 % figure means for bilateral aid , so will she confirm the bilateral spend for Sudan this year ? Sudan matters . It is not in the UK ’ s national interests for the crossing of red lines in this conflict to persist , to have the displacement of people on this scale , nor to see the further destabilisation of this region of Africa . The right hon . Lady asked about the last week ’ s ICC finding . We acknowledge the ICC Office of the Prosecutor ’ s critical findings that there are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have well been committed , and are continuing to be committed , in Darfur . This is an important milestone in the ICC ’ s investigation into crimes committed in Darfur , and the UK remains steadfast in its commitment to ensure that international humanitarian law is respected and breaches are called out and investigated . The UK remains committed to securing accountability for those responsible for atrocity crimes . This includes reporting the fact - finding mission ’ s mandate and the ICC ’ s ongoing investigation . The right hon . Lady mentioned the attack on El Fasher and the targeting of aid workers . That is an absolute disgrace and a clear violation of international law , and we condemn it .

On 28 January we announced a further £17 million for healthcare , food and shelter , and to support vital infrastructure across the Occupied Palestinian Territories . This was an investment in the ceasefire , which must hold . It is utterly heartbreaking to see the desecration of hostages ’ bodies , and to see men , women and children returning to Gaza to try to rebuild their lives among the rubble . I welcome the Government ’ s efforts on humanitarian aid during this fragile ceasefire , which is becoming more fragile as tanks roll into the west bank . What more can we do to ensure that the ceasefire is implemented in full , and to protect human rights and communities in the west bank ?

Friend is a doughty campaigner on behalf of her constituents in Westminster and the City .

I thank my right hon . Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield ( Sir Andrew Mitchell ) for securing this urgent question on the world ’ s worst humanitarian crisis . I welcome the leadership steps that the UK Government are taking , but will the Minister tell the House what conversations are being had with both the African Union and the United Nations about the possibility of surging peacekeepers into Sudan to protect civilians ? I thank the hon . Lady for her leadership role in the previous Parliament as the chair of the all - party parliamentary group on Sudan and South Sudan and as International Development Minister . There are a number of partners ; she has mentioned some of them . The participants at the London Sudan conference included Egypt , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , the UAE , Qatar , South Sudan , Chad , Kenya , Ethiopia and Uganda , and of course the like - mindeds : Norway , Canada , the USA and Switzerland . It was a perfect moment and the hon . Lady asks how we can continue that . We will redouble our efforts to work with the multilaterals such as the UN and the League of Arab States . There is quite a lot on their agenda at the moment , but it is very important that Sudan is not brought down the agenda just because it is in Africa . That is a fear , which is why it is so good to see the reporting in the Financial Times , The Guardian , and many of our other mainstream newspapers , to keep it in the spotlight . We will ensure that we work bilaterally with the countries we work with in normal times , and on a multilateral level to maintain our leadership role . The humanitarian situation in Sudan is horrific , with the growing perpetration of atrocity crimes against civilians . This is part of a growing pattern of mass atrocity crimes being perpetrated across the world , but the UK Government ’ s strategy on prevention of and response to mass atrocity crimes has not been updated since 2019 . Does the Minister agree that it is time for a fresh approach to this vital issue ? My hon . Friend knows of what she speaks , with her role before she came to this place . I shall take that as an action from today ’ s dialogue . Will the Minister explain to the House what , in practical terms , the Security Council could do , even if all its members were neutral on the question of backing one side over the other ? If two sides are determined to fight one another and neither is dependent on outside military assistance to pursue the conflict , is there anything practical that the Security Council could do , even if it was united and in agreement on the need for an intervention ? The UN Security Council is not just about military intervention , in terms of the security ; as the right hon . Gentleman is aware , it is also about the impact of the diplomatic solutions . As the penholder , the UK has the most important role to try to bring everybody together around the table , which is why we had the London Sudan conference .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-07-16.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-07-16.txt"}, {"score": 0.624273955821991, "chunk_id": "debates2025-07-16_F21", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-07-16.txt", "date": "2025-07-16", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Friend , who is a loud voice here on behalf her Sudanese diaspora . The most important things the UK can do to build on the momentum of the important London Sudan conference — bearing in mind that we were the first to have such a conference — are to continue to base our work on the statement from its co - chairs ; to continue , as she says , to use our role at the United Nations ; and to work through the new friends of Sudan grouping to keep pushing at the highest level , using our position on the UN Security Council to galvanise its action and continue the important supply of aid into the region . I call the shadow Minister . I am grateful to you , Mr Speaker , for granting this urgent question , and my right hon . Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield ( Sir Andrew Mitchell ) for pursuing this matter . The situation in Sudan is dire . We are deeply concerned by the International Criminal Court ’ s findings last week that there are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity may be being committed in Darfur . The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate , with the UN warning on 30 June of drastic cuts to life - saving food aid for Sudanese refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries . Sudan has been identified as the global hunger hotspot of highest concern , and without immediate humanitarian assistance , the risk is terrible . With recent attacks on UN aid convoys , can the Minister provide her latest assessment of the situation and the extent of aid blocking ? How is she ensuring that UK aid — including the £120 million announced at the April Sudan conference — will reach those who need it , and that aid workers are protected ? More broadly , what new measures are the Government taking to compel the warring parties into a ceasefire , to allow more aid in and to facilitate deconfliction for its delivery in the meantime ? How has the Minister supported Sudanese civilian and political forces to engage in constructive dialogue processes such as the Cairo conference , and what is her assessment of the effectiveness of these processes ? Despite the spending review , we are yet to understand what the 0 . 3 % figure means for bilateral aid , so will she confirm the bilateral spend for Sudan this year ? Sudan matters . It is not in the UK ’ s national interests for the crossing of red lines in this conflict to persist , to have the displacement of people on this scale , nor to see the further destabilisation of this region of Africa . The right hon . Lady asked about the last week ’ s ICC finding . We acknowledge the ICC Office of the Prosecutor ’ s critical findings that there are reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have well been committed , and are continuing to be committed , in Darfur . This is an important milestone in the ICC ’ s investigation into crimes committed in Darfur , and the UK remains steadfast in its commitment to ensure that international humanitarian law is respected and breaches are called out and investigated . The UK remains committed to securing accountability for those responsible for atrocity crimes . This includes reporting the fact - finding mission ’ s mandate and the ICC ’ s ongoing investigation . The right hon . Lady mentioned the attack on El Fasher and the targeting of aid workers . That is an absolute disgrace and a clear violation of international law , and we condemn it . She asked what more we have been doing recently .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-07-16.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-07-16.txt"}, {"score": 0.6194410920143127, "chunk_id": "debates2024-05-16_F27", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-05-16.txt", "date": "2024-05-16", "parliament": "UK", "text": "There are real concerns , and I will happily take this up with the Deputy Foreign Secretary when he gets back . Those of us who have constituents of Sudanese origin can relate to the Minister the distress and concern in that community . There is particular concern about the fact that — I think this is now the estimate — anything between 500 , 000 and 1 million refugees are going from Darfur into Chad . Could the Minister explain what support we are providing for those who are in Chad , because at the moment it looks as though the agencies that are there are unable to cope ? The right hon . Gentleman raises a very important point . I can update him that the Deputy Foreign Secretary has recently been to the Chad - Sudan border to see for himself exactly the flow that the right hon . Gentleman identifies . He saw the “ sheer horror ” and “ misery ” — his words , not mine — that these appalling acts have created , and he is very focused on ensuring that we use our humanitarian aid to think about how we can provide support across every part of this terrible situation . I intend no disrespect to the Minister , but the Government ’ s response just does not seem to be as robust as it could be given the severity of the situation in Sudan , which is horrific . She will have read reports in The Guardian about children — alive children — being “ piled up and shot ” by RSF paramilitaries in El Geneina . What mechanisms are the Government considering to prevent this genocide from spreading to El Fasher ? As the hon . Gentleman highlights , this is an appalling situation . I have just highlighted , in relation to the Deputy Foreign Secretary ’ s visit , the sheer horror and misery being wrought on these innocent people across the area , which is absolutely beyond words . As I say , there are now very clear signs of ethnic cleansing and appalling humanitarian abuses . We are providing support for the gathering of evidence , and we will continue to try to support those gathering information on the ground — be they NGOs or civilians — to make sure that those who are committing the atrocities will be held to account . As I understand it , previous regional efforts to agree on the deployment of a peace - keeping force in Sudan were rebuffed last year , but I find it incredibly hard to see how ever - escalating atrocity and indeed catastrophe can be avoided without one . Is that even on the agenda now , because otherwise it seems to me we are talking here not so much about atrocity prevention as about atrocity monitoring ? As I say , we have continued to raise this at recent meetings of the UN Security Council , and decisions on how to move forward to provide protection for innocent people will be taken with international partners . With thousands of women being killed in this war , the catastrophic humanitarian crisis particularly impacting women and the fact that women comprise over 70 % of the internally displaced people in Sudan , what measures are the Government taking to protect women in El Fasher ? The hon . Lady raises a really important point about an incredibly worrying situation . Women and girls are at particular risk of a significant escalation in gender - based violence . In July last year , the UK and 15 of other members of the international alliance on preventing sexual violence in conflict published a statement urging all parties to prevent violence , particularly sexual violence , and to ensure immediate humanitarian access .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-05-16.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-05-16.txt"}, {"score": 0.616889238357544, "chunk_id": "debates2024-04-22_F23", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-04-22.txt", "date": "2024-04-22", "parliament": "UK", "text": "The hon . Gentleman is right to say that a ceasefire is essential , with troops returning to barracks and the opening up of a political track , and that is the central thrust of the British Government ’ s policy . He acknowledges that we have managed nearly to double aid to £89 million this year . For South Sudan — this , of course , also addresses many of the problems of Sudan — the figure for this financial year is £111 million , which is more than double what it was . That includes multilateral and bilateral spend . The fact that Britain has doubled its contribution gives it a locus , which was well used by my noble friend Lord Benyon last week in Paris at the Sudan conference , to make the point about other countries also supporting , given the desperate plight in which so many in Sudan find themselves . I welcome this urgent question and the Government ’ s response . We regularly talk about what is going on in Ukraine and the middle east , but we do not focus on the continent of Africa , or Sudan , which is turning into a failed state . There is every prospect of what is going on in Sudan spilling out into other parts of central Africa and the Sahel . Will the Deputy Foreign Secretary update the House on whether we have any presence in Port Sudan ? He talks about peace talks . Egypt has also engaged in those , so can he update the House on the prospect of what is happening bringing the necessary parties together ? In respect of my right hon . Friend ’ s final point , we are hopeful that the third set of negotiations in Jeddah will take place . The Saudis committed on 15 April to that happening in early May , and we are extremely grateful to the Saudis for that and for inviting the UAE , Egypt , the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development to be part of the negotiations . The former Chairman of the Defence Committee is right about the danger of contagion across the region . We are doing everything we can to support Abdalla Hamdok and the Taqaddum , as I mentioned earlier . In terms of our support within Sudan , the ambassador is currently based in Addis Ababa and is working energetically with all the relevant parties to try to make progress . The Sudanese community in Liverpool , Riverside , will be decidedly underwhelmed by the Minister ’ s response to this urgent question . He mentioned supporting people moving to neighbouring areas , but he did not mention the Sudanese who have lived , worked and contributed for years to the UK bringing over family members who are fleeing the conflict , or extending student visas or protections for Sudanese asylum seekers . What will it take for the UK to provide a visa programme for Sudanese asylum seekers , similar to the Ukrainian scheme ? The two situations are not analogous . If the Labour party wants to launch a campaign for extra visas and a special scheme matching the one in Ukraine , I look forward to hearing details of it . My wife and I spent a wonderful holiday in Sudan a few years ago , and it was wonderful to see the amazing people there , as well as the rich cultural heritage that Sudan has to offer . There are many world heritage sites , such as the pyramids of Meroë — there are more pyramids in Sudan than Egypt — ancient cathedrals , and even Lord Kitchener ’ s boat . We hear that fighting has spread to some of the world heritage areas .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-22.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-22.txt"}, {"score": 0.6131168603897095, "chunk_id": "debates2025-02-25_F14", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-02-25.txt", "date": "2025-02-25", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Friend referred to the famine designation . We regret the fact that the Sudanese armed forces have said that they will not co - operate with that assessment , but we have seen both the RSF and the SAF restricting aid and using it as a weapon of war , and that must end . The Genocide80Twenty campaign group at Hampton school in my constituency recently met members of the Darfur diaspora who have fled the atrocities in Sudan , and they would like to know what the UK Government are doing to help those targeted simply for who they are . With a staggering 16 million children desperately needing food , shelter , healthcare and education , could I ask the Minister for assurances that we will not see any cuts to UK aid to the region , and what assessment has she has made of the impact of the Trump Administration ’ s cuts to US aid ? The hon . Member is right to raise the disturbing accounts of atrocities that we have heard . She will be pleased to know that the UK led efforts to renew the UN Human Rights Council fact - finding mission mandate last October , and I was very pleased to see additional African countries coming on board with that . We have doubled our aid to Sudan , so that commitment is not in doubt . I welcome the Government pushing a ceasefire in Sudan and doubling aid . Sudan ’ s civil war , now in its third year , has triggered one of the worst humanitarian crises of the decade , with 5 . 1 million internally displaced people and 1 . 3 million refugees since April 2023 , and famine is now looming . Given this , will the Minister outline what urgent steps the Government are taking with their international counterparts to help de - escalate the conflict in Sudan ?

The last time the Minister was in the House talking about Sudan , she told us it was important to have trust in the international system . Given that the RSF are accused of ethnic cleansing and genocide , are so far acting with complete impunity and have just pledged to form a rival Government , what are the UK Government doing to garner trust in the international system and to hold the RSF to account ? I regret that we see both parties to the conflict behaving in a manner that is having a truly catastrophic impact on civilians — we see famine and appalling levels of conflict - related sexual violence — and the international community must step up . That is why the Foreign Secretary is seeking to convene leaders on this in April , why I have pulled together Development Ministers on this and why we have repeatedly raised these issues at the UN . If he will take diplomatic steps to help ensure accountability for alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka . The UK Government are committed to human rights in Sri Lanka and are leading international efforts to promote accountability and human rights , including at the UN Human Rights Council .

We are deeply concerned at a number of the developments he mentions . The UK is providing , and will continue to provide , significant humanitarian support to Gaza . However , we are also clear that Israel must meet its commitment to “ flood Gaza with aid ” — that is vital . I very much welcome the Foreign Secretary ’ s decisions on the International Criminal Court and on UNRWA funding . This morning I met Oxfam , which told me and other Members that , when Parliament is in recess this summer , up to 7 , 000 people in Gaza will be killed or injured — up to a third of them children . Given that , will the Minister outline what urgent steps the Government will take this summer to end this horror , including ending UK arms sales to Israel ? Too many people have died in Gaza and too little aid is getting in . We are clear that Israel must take concrete steps to protect civilians and aid workers , in accordance with international humanitarian law . This includes deconfliction between military and humanitarian operations , and supporting the minimum operating requirements of the UN agencies , as well , of course , as the other matters my right hon . Friend the Foreign Secretary laid out , including the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire . Last week , I met some of my constituents in Ealing Southall who live in the Hanwell Broadway area . They told me about Hanwell Friends of Sabastiya , a friendship and support network between our corner of west London and a village in the north of the west bank . My constituents have heard at first hand how Palestinians are suffering across the territory . What difference will the decision to restart UNRWA funding make to the lives of ordinary Palestinians , and what discussions has the Minister had with UNRWA ’ s commissioner - general to maximise its impact for the Palestinian people ? I am grateful to my hon . Friend for raising this matter , because we are clear that UNRWA is the only humanitarian organisation that is able to operate at the scale required in Gaza . The Foreign Secretary , as hon . Members will be aware , confirmed to the House on 19 July that the UK would resume funding to UNRWA . On the same day , I met UNRWA Commissioner - General Philippe Lazzarini to understand more from him about the situation on the ground and the reforms that UNRWA is undertaking . We also talked about this Government ’ s release of £21 million in new funds to UNRWA to support its lifesaving work in Gaza and the provision of basic services in the region . My constituents are appalled by the death and destruction in Gaza . They know , as we do , that only an immediate , permanent ceasefire in exchange for the return of the hostages will put an end to this unacceptable and unbearable suffering . In the meantime , despite the Israeli Government ’ s promise to flood Gaza with aid , which the Minister mentioned , the reality is that they are putting in place repeated and deadly obstructions . What conversations have the Government had with Israel to ensure that the Israelis end this denial of lifesaving assistance ? I know that my hon .

Friend ’ s constituents will be best served by a Labour council delivering on this issue and will want to think about that ahead of this Thursday . My constituent — a child who attends alternative provision — was physically restrained by his passenger assistant on school transport , which caused significant distress to him and his family . The Department for Education has published guidance on the use of reasonable force in schools in England , but it appears that there is a gap when it comes to the use of reasonable force on school transport . Will the Minister meet my constituent and me to discuss this case with a view to closing this loophole with the funding that it requires ? The hon . Gentleman raises an important point , and it is one that we are looking at as a Department . Obviously , home - to - school transport is an important aspect of accessing education , but it needs to be safe for all children . I would be more than happy to discuss the issue further with him . What recent assessment she has made of the adequacy of higher education funding . The Tories were more interested in picking ideological fights than ensuring that universities were financially sustainable . They left students and taxpayers to bear the brunt . Labour has taken tough decisions to shore up higher education as we pave the way for reform . We will fix the foundations of higher education to deliver change for students . Over half of UK universities , including the University of York , are again consulting on academic and staff redundancies . In line with the University and College Union ’ s “ Stop the Cuts ” week of action , does the Minister agree that we need an urgent review into higher education funding and visa arrangements for international students and their dependants , and that we need to protect students from poverty , to safeguard our world - class universities and , ultimately , drive research , innovation and their economic output ? We are committed to securing the future of our higher education sector and we absolutely recognise its excellent economic value , which is crucial to our future economic growth . We welcome international students , who enrich our campuses , forge networks with domestic students and become global ambassadors . We will set out our plan for reform in the summer . Over the past few months , Bournemouth University has had to take steps to suspend 15 of its courses due to financial pressures and rising operational costs . Most were arts and humanities courses , including English , photography , sociology and politics . What options exist for universities to access other sources of funding , and what assessment is being done to protect arts and humanities courses across our higher education sector ? I thank the hon . Member for her level of concern . Higher education providers are autonomous and responsible for managing their own budgets . If they were at any risk , we would work with the Office for Students to ensure that students were protected . The Government reserve the right to intervene to protect the interests of students .

We are deeply concerned at a number of the developments he mentions . The UK is providing , and will continue to provide , significant humanitarian support to Gaza . However , we are also clear that Israel must meet its commitment to “ flood Gaza with aid ” — that is vital . I very much welcome the Foreign Secretary ’ s decisions on the International Criminal Court and on UNRWA funding . This morning I met Oxfam , which told me and other Members that , when Parliament is in recess this summer , up to 7 , 000 people in Gaza will be killed or injured — up to a third of them children . Given that , will the Minister outline what urgent steps the Government will take this summer to end this horror , including ending UK arms sales to Israel ? Too many people have died in Gaza and too little aid is getting in . We are clear that Israel must take concrete steps to protect civilians and aid workers , in accordance with international humanitarian law . This includes deconfliction between military and humanitarian operations , and supporting the minimum operating requirements of the UN agencies , as well , of course , as the other matters my right hon . Friend the Foreign Secretary laid out , including the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire . Last week , I met some of my constituents in Ealing Southall who live in the Hanwell Broadway area . They told me about Hanwell Friends of Sabastiya , a friendship and support network between our corner of west London and a village in the north of the west bank . My constituents have heard at first hand how Palestinians are suffering across the territory . What difference will the decision to restart UNRWA funding make to the lives of ordinary Palestinians , and what discussions has the Minister had with UNRWA ’ s commissioner - general to maximise its impact for the Palestinian people ? I am grateful to my hon . Friend for raising this matter , because we are clear that UNRWA is the only humanitarian organisation that is able to operate at the scale required in Gaza . The Foreign Secretary , as hon . Members will be aware , confirmed to the House on 19 July that the UK would resume funding to UNRWA . On the same day , I met UNRWA Commissioner - General Philippe Lazzarini to understand more from him about the situation on the ground and the reforms that UNRWA is undertaking . We also talked about this Government ’ s release of £21 million in new funds to UNRWA to support its lifesaving work in Gaza and the provision of basic services in the region . My constituents are appalled by the death and destruction in Gaza . They know , as we do , that only an immediate , permanent ceasefire in exchange for the return of the hostages will put an end to this unacceptable and unbearable suffering . In the meantime , despite the Israeli Government ’ s promise to flood Gaza with aid , which the Minister mentioned , the reality is that they are putting in place repeated and deadly obstructions . What conversations have the Government had with Israel to ensure that the Israelis end this denial of lifesaving assistance ? I know that my hon .

Friend ’ s constituents will be best served by a Labour council delivering on this issue and will want to think about that ahead of this Thursday . My constituent — a child who attends alternative provision — was physically restrained by his passenger assistant on school transport , which caused significant distress to him and his family . The Department for Education has published guidance on the use of reasonable force in schools in England , but it appears that there is a gap when it comes to the use of reasonable force on school transport . Will the Minister meet my constituent and me to discuss this case with a view to closing this loophole with the funding that it requires ? The hon . Gentleman raises an important point , and it is one that we are looking at as a Department . Obviously , home - to - school transport is an important aspect of accessing education , but it needs to be safe for all children . I would be more than happy to discuss the issue further with him . What recent assessment she has made of the adequacy of higher education funding . The Tories were more interested in picking ideological fights than ensuring that universities were financially sustainable . They left students and taxpayers to bear the brunt . Labour has taken tough decisions to shore up higher education as we pave the way for reform . We will fix the foundations of higher education to deliver change for students . Over half of UK universities , including the University of York , are again consulting on academic and staff redundancies . In line with the University and College Union ’ s “ Stop the Cuts ” week of action , does the Minister agree that we need an urgent review into higher education funding and visa arrangements for international students and their dependants , and that we need to protect students from poverty , to safeguard our world - class universities and , ultimately , drive research , innovation and their economic output ? We are committed to securing the future of our higher education sector and we absolutely recognise its excellent economic value , which is crucial to our future economic growth . We welcome international students , who enrich our campuses , forge networks with domestic students and become global ambassadors . We will set out our plan for reform in the summer . Over the past few months , Bournemouth University has had to take steps to suspend 15 of its courses due to financial pressures and rising operational costs . Most were arts and humanities courses , including English , photography , sociology and politics . What options exist for universities to access other sources of funding , and what assessment is being done to protect arts and humanities courses across our higher education sector ? I thank the hon . Member for her level of concern . Higher education providers are autonomous and responsible for managing their own budgets .

The Minister of State was asked — What steps he is taking to help improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza . What steps he is taking to help improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza . If he will resume funding of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East . We are doing all we can to increase aid into Gaza . With our allies , we will take decisions on the future of UNRWA funding after scrutinising Catherine Colonna ’ s interim report on UNRWA neutrality . We have heard this morning some shocking reports about Palestinian medical staff in Gaza being blindfolded , detained , forced to strip and repeatedly beaten by Israeli troops , after a raid on Nasser Hospital last month . There is footage from Khan Yunis showing men stripped and kneeling , and patients with their hands bound being wheeled in beds . Do the UK Government believe that the Israeli Government are responsible for the conduct of their forces , and that this clearly appears to be torture and is in breach of international law , including the universal declaration of human rights and article 18 of the Geneva convention ? What are the UK Government going to do about this ? The hon . Lady is right to say that Israel must comply with the Geneva convention . We have seen these reports . A full explanation and investigation is required , and that is what the British Government are pressing for . I point out to her that , when it comes to targeting operations , lawyers are embedded in the Israeli and Israel Defence Forces command , just as happens in Britain , which should ensure the acceptance and honouring of international humanitarian law . But I agree that a full explanation is required . For months we have seen the horrifying images of children in Gaza mutilated or killed by bombing , and now we see them starving . Aid by air and sea is welcome , but it is insufficient and it is a diversion from Israel ’ s responsibility . Yesterday , 12 Israeli human rights organisations called out their own Government for failing to comply with the International Court of Justice ruling to facilitate access for humanitarian aid . Does the Minister agree that the Israeli Government should be told by the UK and our allies to unlock aid and end the killing , or face real consequences ? As the hon . Gentleman knows , the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have both pressed Prime Minister Netanyahu , and indeed President Herzog , to ensure that more aid can get into Gaza . As the hon . Gentleman will also know , it is the policy of the British Government to do everything we can to achieve a pause so that we can get the hostages out and get more aid in , and move towards a sustainable ceasefire . We are doing everything we can to try to achieve that . What we are seeing in Gaza is a starvation - level event . The United States has taken the desperate measure of air drops and flotillas , which do not direct aid like land - based aid . The only organisation big enough to fully distribute aid in order to avoid starvation is UNRWA . Canada reviewed the interim report of the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services and has resumed funding . Sweden has received bilateral assurances on the same actions that the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office is supposedly looking for from UNRWA and has resumed funding .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-12.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-12.txt"}, {"score": 22.120504605390746, "chunk_id": "debates2023-10-23_F1", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-10-23.txt", "date": "2023-10-23", "parliament": "UK", "text": "We have already begun the reform programme and have just launched the nine SEND change partnerships , which are already starting to make a difference to the provision .

Sir David was a dedicated constituency MP and a powerful advocate for Southend - on - Sea , which was granted city status last year in his honour . He was a committed campaigner for the causes he believed in — most notably , animal welfare — and a highly respected and valued colleague , known to Members in all parts of the House for his kindness , his generosity and , of course , his friendship to all . He is sorely missed . Hear , hear . The following Members made and subscribed the Affirmation required by law : Sarah Siena Edwards , Tamworth . Alistair Luke Strathern , Mid Bedfordshire . Ordered , That the promoters of the City of London ( Markets ) Bill , which was originally introduced in this House in this Session on 30 January 2023 , should have leave to suspend any further proceedings on the Bill from the day on which the current Session ends in order to proceed with it , if they think fit , in the next Session of Parliament , according to the provisions of Private Business Standing Order 188A ( Suspension of bills ) . — ( The Chairman of Ways and Means . ) Ordered , That the promoters of the Bishop ’ s Stortford Cemetery Bill [ Lords ] , which was originally introduced in the House of Lords in this Session on 23 January 2023 , should have leave to suspend any further proceedings on the Bill from the day on which the current session ends in order to proceed with it , if they think fit , in the next Session of Parliament according to the provisions of Private Business Standing Order 188A ( Suspension of bills ) . — ( The Chairman of Ways and Means . ) Thank you , Chairman of Ways and Means ; that was very effective . May I say , I would expect nothing less ? The Secretary of State was asked — What progress her Department has made on ensuring equality of school funding through the national funding formula . What assessment she has made of the adequacy of core school funding for the 2023 - 24 academic year . The Government introduced fairness into school funding . Under Labour , we got disproportionately inflated school budgets in places such as London , while constituencies such as mine were underfunded for over a decade . It was the Conservatives who introduced the national funding formula , which funds schools fairly , objectively and , most importantly , based on the needs of pupils , not political ideology . Not only that : this year , school budgets are up by over £3 . 9 billion , and next year schools will be funded at their highest level in history , at £59 . 6 billion . My right hon . Friend will be aware that Worcestershire County Council languishes among the weakest 10 local authorities for funding per pupil . As a result , a lot of pressure has been put on other budgets , including the high needs and special educational needs and disabilities budget .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-10-23.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-10-23.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2023-10-23.txt | debates2023-10-23_F1 | 2023-10-23 | UK", "debates2024-03-12.txt | debates2024-03-12_F0 | 2024-03-12 | UK", "debates2024-03-12.txt | debates2024-03-12_F7 | 2024-03-12 | UK", "debates2024-07-30.txt | debates2024-07-30_F16 | 2024-07-30 | UK", "debates2025-04-28.txt | debates2025-04-28_F16 | 2025-04-28 | UK"], "answer": "The speech dates are: 2023-10-23, 2024-03-12, 2024-07-30, 2025-04-28.

The best way to deal with a sustainable ceasefire is obviously to deal with the ongoing humanitarian crisis , and that is best done by UNRWA , not through individual bilateral actions . The Minister mentions states that have suspended their funding , and the situation is evolving really fast . The EU has just announced €50 million for UNRWA , and two further tranches of €16 million , subject to the satisfactory completion of an audit . I take the point that no funding is due from the UK to UNRWA until April , but what further reassurance does the UK need to ensure the funding will be in place , because UNRWA is the best organisation to disburse it and the UK risks being very much on the wrong side of these developments ? I do not agree with the hon . Gentleman ’ s last point . It is true that Canada , Sweden , Spain and the EU , with conditions , expect to be able to resume funding , but as I mentioned earlier , America , Germany , Australia , Italy , Finland , the Netherlands and Switzerland take the same view as us . To the substantive points he makes , we are in discussions with the leader of UNRWA , Mr Lazzarini , and we are awaiting the report from the former French Foreign Minister and the report from the UN . We hope that as a result of those reports , sufficient change will be secured , so that we can continue to fund UNRWA , but the hon . Gentleman should be in no doubt that we have fully funded UNRWA into the next financial year . What diplomatic steps his Department is taking to help tackle illegal migration . We are engaging with international partners on a “ whole of route ” approach to addressing irregular migration . This includes : a multi - year operational plan with France to stop small boats ; developing partnerships to tackle organised immigration crime ; improving returns processes ; and working with partner countries through a number of international fora to address the root causes . Small boat crossings continue to be a massive concern for my constituents , many of whom point out to me that there is some logic to the argument that if those who illegally enter our country from France , a safe European country , were returned on the same day , the problem would probably be dealt with overnight . Has my right hon . Friend discussed this with her French counterpart , and is her counterpart open to this undeniable logic ? If so , why does France not accept them back on the same day ? My hon . Friend raises a point that is raised in many of our postbags . The reality is that individuals in need of international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach ; that will always be the fastest route to safety . We , of course , continue to work collaboratively with our European partners , including France , to address our shared migration challenges . I can update the House that our partnership with France has helped to bring down small boat arrivals , and together we stopped more than 26 , 000 crossings last years . I thank the Minister for her response . We in Northern Ireland have a border with the Republic of Ireland . What discussions has she had with her counterparts in the devolved nations , and particularly in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Police Service of Northern Ireland , about tackling illegal migration ? I am ever mindful that we have a land border that needs to be patrolled and policed .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-12.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-12.txt"}, {"score": 22.127882068778312, "chunk_id": "debates2024-03-12_F0", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-03-12.txt", "date": "2024-03-12", "parliament": "UK", "text": "[Document date: 2024-03-12]\nBill read the Third time and passed , with amendments .

With our allies , we will take decisions on the future of UNRWA funding after scrutinising Catherine Colonna ’ s interim report on UNRWA neutrality . We have heard this morning some shocking reports about Palestinian medical staff in Gaza being blindfolded , detained , forced to strip and repeatedly beaten by Israeli troops , after a raid on Nasser Hospital last month . There is footage from Khan Yunis showing men stripped and kneeling , and patients with their hands bound being wheeled in beds . Do the UK Government believe that the Israeli Government are responsible for the conduct of their forces , and that this clearly appears to be torture and is in breach of international law , including the universal declaration of human rights and article 18 of the Geneva convention ? What are the UK Government going to do about this ? The hon . Lady is right to say that Israel must comply with the Geneva convention . We have seen these reports . A full explanation and investigation is required , and that is what the British Government are pressing for . I point out to her that , when it comes to targeting operations , lawyers are embedded in the Israeli and Israel Defence Forces command , just as happens in Britain , which should ensure the acceptance and honouring of international humanitarian law . But I agree that a full explanation is required . For months we have seen the horrifying images of children in Gaza mutilated or killed by bombing , and now we see them starving . Aid by air and sea is welcome , but it is insufficient and it is a diversion from Israel ’ s responsibility . Yesterday , 12 Israeli human rights organisations called out their own Government for failing to comply with the International Court of Justice ruling to facilitate access for humanitarian aid . Does the Minister agree that the Israeli Government should be told by the UK and our allies to unlock aid and end the killing , or face real consequences ? As the hon . Gentleman knows , the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have both pressed Prime Minister Netanyahu , and indeed President Herzog , to ensure that more aid can get into Gaza . As the hon . Gentleman will also know , it is the policy of the British Government to do everything we can to achieve a pause so that we can get the hostages out and get more aid in , and move towards a sustainable ceasefire . We are doing everything we can to try to achieve that . What we are seeing in Gaza is a starvation - level event . The United States has taken the desperate measure of air drops and flotillas , which do not direct aid like land - based aid . The only organisation big enough to fully distribute aid in order to avoid starvation is UNRWA . Canada reviewed the interim report of the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services and has resumed funding . Sweden has received bilateral assurances on the same actions that the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office is supposedly looking for from UNRWA and has resumed funding .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-12.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-12.txt"}, {"score": 22.120504605390746, "chunk_id": "debates2023-10-23_F1", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-10-23.txt", "date": "2023-10-23", "parliament": "UK", "text": "We have already begun the reform programme and have just launched the nine SEND change partnerships , which are already starting to make a difference to the provision .

Sir David was a dedicated constituency MP and a powerful advocate for Southend - on - Sea , which was granted city status last year in his honour . He was a committed campaigner for the causes he believed in — most notably , animal welfare — and a highly respected and valued colleague , known to Members in all parts of the House for his kindness , his generosity and , of course , his friendship to all . He is sorely missed . Hear , hear . The following Members made and subscribed the Affirmation required by law : Sarah Siena Edwards , Tamworth . Alistair Luke Strathern , Mid Bedfordshire . Ordered , That the promoters of the City of London ( Markets ) Bill , which was originally introduced in this House in this Session on 30 January 2023 , should have leave to suspend any further proceedings on the Bill from the day on which the current Session ends in order to proceed with it , if they think fit , in the next Session of Parliament , according to the provisions of Private Business Standing Order 188A ( Suspension of bills ) . — ( The Chairman of Ways and Means . ) Ordered , That the promoters of the Bishop ’ s Stortford Cemetery Bill [ Lords ] , which was originally introduced in the House of Lords in this Session on 23 January 2023 , should have leave to suspend any further proceedings on the Bill from the day on which the current session ends in order to proceed with it , if they think fit , in the next Session of Parliament according to the provisions of Private Business Standing Order 188A ( Suspension of bills ) . — ( The Chairman of Ways and Means . ) Thank you , Chairman of Ways and Means ; that was very effective . May I say , I would expect nothing less ? The Secretary of State was asked — What progress her Department has made on ensuring equality of school funding through the national funding formula . What assessment she has made of the adequacy of core school funding for the 2023 - 24 academic year . The Government introduced fairness into school funding . Under Labour , we got disproportionately inflated school budgets in places such as London , while constituencies such as mine were underfunded for over a decade . It was the Conservatives who introduced the national funding formula , which funds schools fairly , objectively and , most importantly , based on the needs of pupils , not political ideology . Not only that : this year , school budgets are up by over £3 . 9 billion , and next year schools will be funded at their highest level in history , at £59 . 6 billion . My right hon . Friend will be aware that Worcestershire County Council languishes among the weakest 10 local authorities for funding per pupil . As a result , a lot of pressure has been put on other budgets , including the high needs and special educational needs and disabilities budget .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-10-23.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-10-23.txt"}, {"score": 22.105623901777847, "chunk_id": "debates2025-01-13_F14", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-01-13.txt", "date": "2025-01-13", "parliament": "UK", "text": "The Home Secretary ’ s policy is to make asylum decisions quickly , so that any costs of the migrants she accepts can be hidden in the welfare system . The Home Office admits in its impact assessments that it has no idea how much her policy will cost in benefits claims and council housing bills . Will the Minister commit today to recording and publishing all those costs for migrants whose asylum claims she accepts ? I will take no lessons from the Conservative party , which spent £700 million to send four volunteers to Rwanda and left huge backlogs of more than 90 , 000 stopped asylum claims — people in hotels , unable to leave because the Conservatives were trying to get their fantasy Rwanda programme off the ground . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . My constituent Majida and her three children are asylum seekers from Syria , living in one of the two asylum hotels in my Hazel Grove constituency . They have been living in limbo for nine months as they wait for a decision on their asylum claim . Like all Syrian asylum seekers , their applications have been temporarily paused following the fall of Assad . Many in my community are keen to support those seeking asylum , but also very keen to see an end to the use of hotels . The cost of housing families in that way is too high , both to the mental wellbeing of those living there and to the taxpayer . What circumstances is the Minister waiting for to resume decision making on asylum applications from Syrians , and when does she expect that to happen ? The fall of the Assad regime was a welcome development , given that he was a tyrant , but 5 , 500 Syrian asylum seekers are currently in our system , many of whom fled the Assad regime . Until Syria ’ s future becomes a little more settled , it is difficult to decide those claims , which is why both this country and most of Europe have had a temporary pause while the situation in Syria settles and develops . I cannot tell the hon . Lady exactly when decision making will resume . All I can say is that we are keeping the matter under close observation . As soon as there is any development in this area , we will ensure that the House knows about it . What steps her Department is taking to support victims of the Windrush scandal . This Labour Government are determined to put right the appalling injustice suffered by members of the Windrush community . We will ensure that those affected receive the compensation they deserve , and that cultural change is embedded permanently in the Home Office . At the end of November 2024 , over £100 million has been paid to individuals across almost 3 , 000 claims under the Windrush compensation scheme . We have also re - established the Windrush unit to drive forward the action needed to ensure that what happened to the Windrush generation never happens again . Members of the Windrush generation who struggle to submit compensation claims do not have access to legal aid , leaving them unable to navigate the complex process . I have recently been contacted by a constituent who is struggling to navigate the claims process , and has no other support available to him . What steps is the Minister taking to tackle those barriers , and will she commit to providing additional support to ensure that every eligible individual can access the scheme , regardless of their capacity or circumstances ? My hon . Friend makes an important point . We are committed to making changes so that the scheme is accessible and so victims of the Windrush scandal are far better supported in applying for compensation .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-01-13.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-01-13.txt"}, {"score": 22.036845965680172, "chunk_id": "debates2024-03-12_F17", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-03-12.txt", "date": "2024-03-12", "parliament": "UK", "text": "When Jeffrey Sachs , a UN adviser — from a Jewish American family , incidentally — says on camera : “ Israel has deliberately starved the people of Gaza… I am not using an exaggeration .

These are zealots ” , does that not give the UK Government pause to reflect on the funding of UNRWA , and to call for a ceasefire and the recognition of Palestine , which 138 of 193 UN member states have done , rather than see it wiped off the map ? I think almost nothing that the hon . Gentleman has just said could possibly be deemed helpful in trying to bring the two sides together , achieve a pause , get the hostages out , get aid in and achieve a sustainable ceasefire . Therefore , I am afraid I am unable to offer any reassurance on any of the points he made . Last week , 287 children aged between five and 12 were kidnapped from their school in Nigeria . That comes on top of 8 , 000 Christians who were killed for their faith last year . What are we doing about it ? My right hon . Friend is right about these appalling events , and the high commission in Abuja has raised these matters . Our hon . Friend the Member for Congleton ( Fiona Bruce ) , who is responsible for freedom of religion or belief , regularly focuses on what is happening in Nigeria and makes representations , which also ensures that the Foreign Office is kept up to the mark in pursuing it . Canada is to resume funding for UNRWA having received UN reports . Has the UK Government received such reports , are they being reviewed , and when will that review be concluded and decisions be made ? We are asking that we have an interim report on both the key reports as soon as possible , and we will look at those reports as soon as they arrive and make our decisions accordingly . During the course of these questions I have adumbrated both those who are supporting the same position as the UK and those who are restoring funding immediately . The hon . Gentleman will want to bear in mind that Britain has fully funded UNRWA for its share up until the next financial year . I call the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee . Haiti is on the edge of collapse , and only 100 nautical miles away are the Turks and Caicos islands , for whose national security the UK has responsibility . Will the Foreign Office fulfil its role by requesting of the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office that we deploy HMS Trent with its defensive capabilities , deploy Royal Marine fast boats , provide assets monitoring in the sea lane , and increase the policing footprint in TCI ? Too often we have acted too slowly , which in the past that has resulted in threats to remove TCI from our overseas family . Please can we act now ? I assure my hon . Friend that I was recently in TCI and I understand the situation there . We have seen a rise in the number of people making the dangerous journey by sea from Haiti to TCI . We have put in place 13 serious crime investigators and seven firearms , officers , and we are working with the Home Office and the MOD in building capability and capacity in this important situation .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-12.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-12.txt"}, {"score": 21.96347887260456, "chunk_id": "debates2025-04-02_F30", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-04-02.txt", "date": "2025-04-02", "parliament": "UK", "text": "It comes on top of 18 months of collective punishment , including , since 2 March , the longest aid blockade since the war began .

To ensure that the UK is not complicit in Israel ’ s ongoing genocide , illegal occupation and system of apartheid , will the Minister immediately suspend the direct and indirect supply , sale or transfer — including transit and trans - shipment — to Israel of all weapons , munitions and other military and security equipment ? Will he immediately suspend the provision of training and other military and security assistance and recognise that , otherwise , there is a clear risk of contributing to the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law , including crimes under international law ? As the Minister mentioned , the UK is a significant provider of humanitarian aid to the region . What assessment has he made of the impact of today ’ s reports on the humanitarian crisis ? Although he touched on this lightly , given the UK ’ s level of influence with Israeli authorities , will he confirm that he will use his position to actively oppose current and planned attempts by Israel to establish a permanent military presence in Gaza , and to oppose moves to alter Gaza ’ s borders and demographic make - up or to shrink its territory , including through any expanded buffer zones and construction of permanent checkpoints ? The hon . Lady asked a series of important questions . As I have said to the House on a number of occasions , determinations of breaches of international law are for competent courts and we support those courts in their work . On weapons , I want to be clear that we continue to stand by the assessments that we made soberly in September and the suspension of licenses that that involved . The hon . Lady asked about the UK ’ s view on a permanent presence in Gaza . I am happy to restate our policy now . We welcome the proposal by Arab nations , called the Arab initiative , which would allow for a reconstruction of Gaza , the safe return of Palestinians who have been displaced , and for those remaining in Gaza to rebuild their lives without forced displacement , which we oppose . I call the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee . We have had several urgent questions and statements on Gaza over the last few months . Each time , I have come to the Chamber and asked the Government : what is plan B ? What is plan B when Israel ends the ceasefire , which is what has happened ? What is plan B when Israel ’ s far - right Government choose their survival over the lives of the remaining hostages , which is what seems to have happened ? What is plan B when annexation of either the west bank or Gaza is not just threatened but actually happens , which is what is happening now ? My question is this : what are the Government doing to turn our allies ’ heads from American trade wars and towards the tragedy unfolding in the middle east , to do whatever they can to restore a ceasefire and the road to peace ?

That includes within the UN Security Council , as we just discussed , but we have also been taking action at every bilateral and multilateral opportunity , including on polio , where the UK led efforts to get vaccination going in the first place . I call the Chair of the International Development Committee . In October , the Israeli Knesset passed two laws relating to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency : the law for cessation of UNRWA activities in the state of Israel ; and the law for cessation of UNRWA activities . They will take effect on 28 January , and the consequence will be preventing aid distribution in Gaza and the prevention of primary care , education and refuse collection in the west bank . Last week , my Committee was in Palestine and Jordan . There is huge concern that if that legislation takes effect , it will breach numerous international laws and have a catastrophic effect on the humanitarian and security situation in the region . What conversations have Ministers had with their Israeli counterparts to prevent that implementation , and what are they doing with the international community to protect a UN organisation ? I am grateful to my hon . Friend for raising that and to her Committee for its work on this important issue . The UK Government have been absolutely clear that UNRWA is the only agency that can deliver aid at the scale and depth required in the middle of this humanitarian emergency . My hon . Friend asked about representations being made by the UK Government . I have made those representations myself , including at the UN General Assembly . The Under - Secretary of State for Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Affairs , my hon . Friend the Member for Lincoln ( Hamish Falconer ) , made those representations yesterday . The Foreign Secretary has made them a number of times , including to his Israeli counterpart . It is clear that the restrictions on the operation of UNRWA must not be implemented by the Israeli Government . The humanitarian situation in the middle east is made worse by arms supply from within and beyond the region . The Liberal Democrats have a long - standing policy that the UK Government should not be exporting arms to Israel or to the Occupied Palestinian Territories given that they were referred to in the FCDO ’ s last human rights report . Will the FCDO extend the number of arms export licences denied to Israel by the UK ? I gently encourage the hon . Member to look at the action taken by the UK Government some weeks ago to suspend a number of arms licences . We believe that was important because of the risk towards breaking international humanitarian law . The UK Government take their responsibilities in that regard very seriously indeed . The root cause of so much of the terrible humanitarian suffering in the middle east today is the regime in Tehran , fuelling the Houthis , Hamas and Hezbollah and brutally repressing its own people while bailing out Putin ’ s war machine , and even plotting to assassinate individuals based in the UK . Beyond sanctions with Iran — which we all support and successive Governments have put in place over the years — can the Minister tell us , on behalf of the Foreign Secretary , what exactly is the comprehensive plan to start dealing with this repressive regime that is causing so much brutality across the middle east ? We are deeply concerned about the destabilising impact of the Iranian regime within the region and beyond . The right hon . Lady mentioned a number of cases where we can see that impact clearly .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-11-26.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-11-26.txt"}, {"score": 0.5074141025543213, "chunk_id": "debates2024-03-12_F7", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-03-12.txt", "date": "2024-03-12", "parliament": "UK", "text": "I call the Scottish National party spokesperson , Alyn Smith . The best way to deal with a sustainable ceasefire is obviously to deal with the ongoing humanitarian crisis , and that is best done by UNRWA , not through individual bilateral actions . The Minister mentions states that have suspended their funding , and the situation is evolving really fast . The EU has just announced €50 million for UNRWA , and two further tranches of €16 million , subject to the satisfactory completion of an audit . I take the point that no funding is due from the UK to UNRWA until April , but what further reassurance does the UK need to ensure the funding will be in place , because UNRWA is the best organisation to disburse it and the UK risks being very much on the wrong side of these developments ? I do not agree with the hon . Gentleman ’ s last point . It is true that Canada , Sweden , Spain and the EU , with conditions , expect to be able to resume funding , but as I mentioned earlier , America , Germany , Australia , Italy , Finland , the Netherlands and Switzerland take the same view as us . To the substantive points he makes , we are in discussions with the leader of UNRWA , Mr Lazzarini , and we are awaiting the report from the former French Foreign Minister and the report from the UN . We hope that as a result of those reports , sufficient change will be secured , so that we can continue to fund UNRWA , but the hon . Gentleman should be in no doubt that we have fully funded UNRWA into the next financial year . What diplomatic steps his Department is taking to help tackle illegal migration . We are engaging with international partners on a “ whole of route ” approach to addressing irregular migration . This includes : a multi - year operational plan with France to stop small boats ; developing partnerships to tackle organised immigration crime ; improving returns processes ; and working with partner countries through a number of international fora to address the root causes . Small boat crossings continue to be a massive concern for my constituents , many of whom point out to me that there is some logic to the argument that if those who illegally enter our country from France , a safe European country , were returned on the same day , the problem would probably be dealt with overnight . Has my right hon . Friend discussed this with her French counterpart , and is her counterpart open to this undeniable logic ? If so , why does France not accept them back on the same day ? My hon . Friend raises a point that is raised in many of our postbags . The reality is that individuals in need of international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach ; that will always be the fastest route to safety . We , of course , continue to work collaboratively with our European partners , including France , to address our shared migration challenges . I can update the House that our partnership with France has helped to bring down small boat arrivals , and together we stopped more than 26 , 000 crossings last years . I thank the Minister for her response . We in Northern Ireland have a border with the Republic of Ireland . What discussions has she had with her counterparts in the devolved nations , and particularly in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Police Service of Northern Ireland , about tackling illegal migration ? I am ever mindful that we have a land border that needs to be patrolled and policed .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-12.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-12.txt"}, {"score": 0.5012655258178711, "chunk_id": "debates2025-04-03_F31", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-04-03.txt", "date": "2025-04-03", "parliament": "UK", "text": "We are contemplating organising three 90 - minute debates on 1 May , which is local election day .

On Tuesday 8 May , there will be a Westminster Hall debate on the persecution of Christians . When we return on 22 April , there will be a debate on residential estate management companies ; I remind colleagues that we will sit Monday hours on that day , so the debate will start at 11 . 30 am , rather than at 9 . 30 am . On Thursday 24 April , there will be a debate on Lesbian Visibility Week , followed by a debate on the trading relationship with the European Union , which will be quite topical , given the tariff arrangements that have just been announced . On Tuesday 29 April , there will be a debate on compensation for criminal injuries . Most of our allies , including the United States , have indicated their objection to the reappointment of Francesca Albanese as the UN special rapporteur on the occupied territories . This is a woman who has attempted to justify the atrocities on 7 October 2023 , and repeatedly excused the atrocities committed by terrorists , yet she is apparently going to be reappointed by the UN . Our allies have called this out , but there has been total silence from the Foreign Secretary and nothing from any of our Ministers , so may we have a statement on how the Government will instruct our representatives at the UN to vote ? Indeed , will they register their strong objections to her reappointment ?", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-04-03.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-04-03.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2024-03-12.txt | debates2024-03-12_F7 | 2024-03-12 | UK", "debates2024-03-19.txt | debates2024-03-19_F32 | 2024-03-19 | UK", "debates2024-03-19.txt | debates2024-03-19_F33 | 2024-03-19 | UK", "debates2024-03-19.txt | debates2024-03-19_F34 | 2024-03-19 | UK", "debates2024-07-19.txt | debates2024-07-19_F16 | 2024-07-19 | UK", "debates2024-11-26.txt | debates2024-11-26_F12 | 2024-11-26 | UK", "debates2025-03-04.txt | debates2025-03-04_F28 | 2025-03-04 | UK", "debates2025-04-03.txt | debates2025-04-03_F31 | 2025-04-03 | UK"], "answer": "The speech dates are: 2024-03-12, 2024-03-19, 2024-07-19, 2024-11-26, 2025-03-04, 2025-04-03.

What recent diplomatic support he has provided to Ukraine . What discussions he has had with his international counterparts on maintaining support for Ukraine . What recent discussions he has had with his international counterparts on the war in Ukraine . Since February 2020 the UK has committed £357 million of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine . In response to winter we scaled up humanitarian support with additional funding to provide cash assistance , insulation , and support for energy and heating . The Foreign Secretary ’ s first overseas visit was to Ukraine . He continues to set out the UK ambition to international partners and did so in November during NATO and OSCE gatherings , and most recently at Davos , where he met Foreign Minister Kuleba . Tim Bamford , our local councillor for Denby Dale , has devoted his own time and expense to making several potentially dangerous excursions , driving a truck to deliver essential humanitarian aid to war - torn Ukraine alongside volunteers from the Yorkshire Aid Convoy . Will the Minister join me in thanking Tim — who is sitting in the Public Gallery — and all the fantastic team at the Yorkshire Aid Convoy for everything that they are doing to help the Ukrainian people , and wish them a safe journey for their next trip in March ? I am delighted to join my hon . Friend in thanking Tim and Tina Bamford , both of whom are in the Public Gallery . The response of the British people to the tragedy in Ukraine has been remarkable and hugely generous , and we salute the courage and generosity of spirit shown by the commendable actions of the Yorkshire Aid Convoy . There are many billions of Russian assets frozen by western nations , and there is a strong moral case for Ukraine to use those assets to repel Russia ’ s aggression and rebuild its own economy . What progress has the Department made in talking to other nations to make that a reality ? I agree that there is a strong moral case for using Russian assets to repair the damage that Russia has wrought on Ukraine . We are clear about the fact that Russia should pay , and we continue to assess what legal path there might be to achieving that end . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recently said : “ I think the big difference from last year to this year is that this year…There is somehow a trend towards getting used to Ukrainian suffering . ” It is more than 200 days since the Opposition tabled a motion necessitating Government legislation to bring about the full seizure and repurposing of Russian state assets within 90 days , but no plan has yet been forthcoming . Why are the Government so out of step with our allies and partners in this regard ? We are not out of step ; we are leading the pack , and have been doing so for the last two years .

The Foreign Secretary mentions specific laws such as the Geneva Conventions (cited by Nizam Mamode) and UN Security Council resolutions, which underline adherence to international law in humanitarian interventions.\n\nWhile national interest is not explicitly addressed in these documents, it can be inferred that moral duty and adherence to international law form a strong foundation for UK's stance on humanitarian intervention.

We are clear about the fact that Russia should pay , and we continue to assess what legal path there might be to achieving that end . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recently said : “ I think the big difference from last year to this year is that this year…There is somehow a trend towards getting used to Ukrainian suffering . ” It is more than 200 days since the Opposition tabled a motion necessitating Government legislation to bring about the full seizure and repurposing of Russian state assets within 90 days , but no plan has yet been forthcoming .

In the past nine weeks , over 250 Palestinians — including 69 children — have been killed by the Israeli security forces in the west bank , and over the past year we have seen a dangerous rise in the number of attacks by violent , illegal Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their property . Even the United States announced that it would impose a travel ban on violent extremist settlers last week , but all the UK Government have been able to announce is that planning is going on . How much more bloodshed do we need to see before the Government stop planning and start acting , and will the Minister take real action today against violent , illegal settlers ? I made clear in my answer to Question 1 that the Government condemn without qualification the illegal attacks by settlers on Palestinians . The hon . Gentleman asks me specifically about visa bans ; while I cannot give a commentary in this House , I can tell him that our plans in that respect are moving forward . A stop - start approach is likely to prolong hostage captivity and increase the risk to hostages ’ lives . It also continues the relentless loss of civilians and innocent children . If the UN Security Council resolution returns with a condemnation of Hamas , will the UK do the right thing this time and back an immediate humanitarian ceasefire ? As the hon . Lady will know , not least from the urgent question asked in the House yesterday by the right hon . Member for Tottenham ( Mr Lammy ) , neither the Government nor the Opposition believe that a ceasefire is the right way to proceed . However , I can tell her that we are very heavily engaged in what is happening in these Security Council resolutions , and the Security Council permanent members were at Rafah yesterday , looking in detail at the situation on the ground . There has to be a ceasefire to protect civilians in Gaza . Does the Minister agree with the US Secretary for Defence when he said that “ protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative ” , and that “ if you drive them into the arms of the enemy , you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat ” ? Are the Government making those representations to the Israeli Government ? Of course , the position of the American Defence Secretary is exactly the position of the British Government , and that is why we say at all points that everyone must adhere international humanitarian law . The whole House is appalled by the atrocities committed by Hamas , but also by the civilian suffering in Gaza . Will my right hon . Friend set out the steps he is taking to relieve civilian suffering , and also the steps he is taking against illegal settlements and the actions of violent settlers , because they are an obstacle to the two - state solution and to a lasting and just peace ? On the first part of my hon . Friend ’ s question , I can tell him that we have delivered 74 tonnes of aid to el - Arish , which we are trying to make sure gets in . On specific relief , I can inform the House that 100 trucks and 120 , 600 litres of fuel did get across the border into Rafah yesterday .

Members will be taking part in remembrance services across the nation and overseas this weekend . Medals proudly worn by our veterans are not just thanks from a grateful nation ; they are a message for the rest of us . We should remember their service and sacrifice , but also the lessons that made their service and sacrifice both necessary and possible . This weekend , as we attend services and lay wreaths beside memorials , we should reflect on how best to honour them and the freedoms we enjoy because of them , and protect their precious legacy . The shadow Leader of the House started by talking about the cost of living . I am sorry that , as she did so , she did not recognise that this week we have paid out £2 . 2 billion in cost of living payments and that 99 % of households eligible for the cost of living payment have already received it from this Government . I disagree with the hon . Lady , because I do not think that our cost of living issues are remotely helped by lessening our energy security , which is why we are bringing forward the Bill and why I ask her party to support it . It is not at all incompatible with investing in renewable energy and clean technology . The hon . Lady is rather fond of criticising both our record and our plans for this Session , so it might be helpful to get the scores on the doors . She believes that our 43 Bills , 1 , 000 statutory instruments and record number of private Members ’ Bills — 24 — passed in the third Session of this Parliament is a shabby record . I point out to her that only in two of the 13 parliamentary Sessions between 1997 and 2010 were more Bills put through than we put through in the last Session . In the last Sessions of Labour Administrations , the average number of Bills brought forward was 21 . The hon . Lady cannot justify her charge against us about the amount we have got done . She might be relying on the time it took us — it did take us less time than we had allocated to pass a lot of that legislation and to do Government business — but that is not really a problem for those on the Government Benches ; it is a more a problem for those on the Opposition Benches , although I have no complaints about that . Those on the Government side of the House have been pulling their weight , even in Opposition day debates — in debates on school safety and animal welfare , for example , there were more Conservative speakers than Opposition speakers . Let me go into the specific points that the hon . Lady raised . On tents , the Home Secretary has no plans to ban Millets — we are not doing that . The Government have made the largest investment ever in tackling homelessness and rough sleeping , providing £2 billion to accelerate its mitigation and prevention , including preventing 640 , 000 people from becoming homeless in the last five years . On conversion therapy , we have a manifesto commitment , and it is still a manifesto commitment . The Secretary of State will keep the House informed on the work she is doing on this important matter . I was surprised to hear the hon . Lady raise nutrient neutrality . I had hoped she would support our measures , but the Secretary of State will no doubt update the House on the further work he is doing in that area .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-11-09.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-11-09.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2023-11-09.txt | debates2023-11-09_F18 | 2023-11-09 | UK", "debates2023-12-12.txt | debates2023-12-12_F4 | 2023-12-12 | UK", "debates2024-01-30.txt | debates2024-01-30_F9 | 2024-01-30 | UK", "debates2024-11-26.txt | debates2024-11-26_F11 | 2024-11-26 | UK", "debates2025-05-14.txt | debates2025-05-14_F26 | 2025-05-14 | UK"], "answer": "The context does not contain this information.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:02:03"}

It is the long - standing position of Governments of all stripes that it is for international courts to make determinations of that nature , and we will abide by our obligations under international humanitarian law . Since 2 March , no food or medical aid supplies have reached over 2 . 3 million Palestinians . Many of us from across this House have attended many statements and Westminster Hall debates and have submitted parliamentary questions asking the Government about this critical issue . The hostages still remain in captivity and need to be released , but the reality is that using aid to punish so many people is wrong . Does the Minister agree that under the genocide convention , the UK as a state party has an obligation not only to prevent and punish genocide , but to avoid actions that may assist or enable genocidal acts ? My hon . Friend asks important questions about aid access and the nature of aid delivery . Let me be clear : the UK will not support any aid mechanism that seeks to deliver political or military objectives or put vulnerable people at risk . The obligations under international humanitarian law and international law more broadly are clear , and they fall on Israel as the occupying power . It must abide by them . Very few issues in politics , particularly international politics , are black or white , but this is one such issue . The Israeli Government are using collective punishment of the civilian Palestinian population , which is illegal under international law and contravenes the Geneva conventions , to which Israel is party . Does the Minister think that the British Government have lost their moral and legal compass in continuing their tacit support for Israel ? I have set out some of what the Government have done , and I could continue doing so for some time . Let me be clear . The hon . Gentleman rightly points out the absolutely appalling nature of any attempt to weaponise aid and use incendiary language , which are clearly breaches of international obligations . We have condemned from the Dispatch Box much of that language , some of which was repeated by the Liberal Democrat spokesperson , the hon . Member for Esher and Walton ( Monica Harding ) . I take this opportunity to say again that the British Government absolutely condemn that inflammatory language . We will continue to do so , and to make our views known to the Israeli Government , in the most forceful possible way . The international community has failed to stop Israel ’ s impunity . We have collectively failed to act on violations as they are committed , and to hold Israel to account . With our collective failure , Palestinians in Gaza face collective punishment . Israeli Ministers have stated that stopping humanitarian aid is one of their main levers of pressure . That is not only cruel and indefensible , but an explicit admission of violations of international law . I hear our condemnations , Minister , but I see no action . Why are we still sending arms ? Why are we not sanctioning Israeli Ministers ? The UN has said what many know to be true : as a signatory to the Geneva convention , we have a legal obligation to prevent genocide . Minister , when will we act ? My hon . Friend is forceful advocate on these questions . She points to failure , and I recognise that failure .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-05-14.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-05-14.txt"}, {"score": 14.050701510881199, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-26_F11", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-26.txt", "date": "2024-11-26", "parliament": "UK", "text": "The humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic . The UK ’ s recent vote for the UN Security Council resolution on Gaza has already been mentioned . It called for a huge scale - up in aid across Gaza . We need that aid access , and restrictions on aid are unacceptable . The International Development Committee heard testimony from Nizam Mamode , a surgeon who has recently returned from the Nasser hospital in Gaza . He described Israeli drones picking off injured children after bombings . His account echoed an October New York Times report , which cited 44 doctors , nurses and paramedics who witnessed numerous cases of pre - pubescent children being shot in the head or chest during the ongoing conflict in Gaza . What steps are the Government taking to prevent a genocide in Gaza ? We have heard a number of deeply concerning reports about developments in Gaza . I know that has also been the case for the Select Committee , as my hon . Friend mentioned . The UK Government ’ s position could not be clearer : international law , including international humanitarian law , must be held to , and that covers in particular the operations of healthcare workers . We pay tribute to them operating in such difficult circumstances . As we have been hearing , the situation in Gaza — especially northern Gaza — is dire , with the UN anticipating that this year up to 60 , 000 children under the age of five could be facing acute malnutrition . At the same time , the trucks entering Gaza have reduced by 63 % since October 2023 . I welcome the leading role that the Government are taking in providing vital humanitarian aid for Gaza , but does the Minister agree that the ongoing Israeli restrictions on the flow of essential aid are completely unacceptable and should be lifted immediately ? Yes . We are seeing a disturbing impact from those restrictions ; we have seen it in the famine assessment and in the levels of malnutrition and ill health now prevalent in Gaza . Winter is now upon us , making the situation even worse . The restrictions on aid are unacceptable . They must be lifted immediately . When the Foreign Secretary was in Baku recently for COP29 , did he discuss with his interlocutors across the region the extent to which the global finance goals would impact on humanitarian assistance in the middle east ? Yes , the Foreign Secretary did discuss those matters , including directly with Mia Mottley , the Premier of Barbados , who has been leading many of the small island developing states on these issues . Certainly , the UK is determined to play its part on humanitarian issues as well as globally on climate issues . That is so important for our own country as well as for the rest of the world . Some weeks ago , I asked the Foreign Secretary about getting assurances that children receiving polio vaccinations would not be killed after receiving them . Since then , thousands of children have been killed in northern Gaza . Given the ICC ’ s recent ruling about war crimes , the British public no doubt want to know why the Government are shying away from their legal and moral obligation to ban all arms and all trade . The UK Government have been determined to use every mechanism to advance international humanitarian law . That includes within the UN Security Council , as we just discussed , but we have also been taking action at every bilateral and multilateral opportunity , including on polio , where the UK led efforts to get vaccination going in the first place .

As soon as there is the possibility of getting more aid and support into Gaza , we will be using those supplies to do exactly that . In the past nine weeks , over 250 Palestinians — including 69 children — have been killed by the Israeli security forces in the west bank , and over the past year we have seen a dangerous rise in the number of attacks by violent , illegal Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their property . Even the United States announced that it would impose a travel ban on violent extremist settlers last week , but all the UK Government have been able to announce is that planning is going on . How much more bloodshed do we need to see before the Government stop planning and start acting , and will the Minister take real action today against violent , illegal settlers ? I made clear in my answer to Question 1 that the Government condemn without qualification the illegal attacks by settlers on Palestinians . The hon . Gentleman asks me specifically about visa bans ; while I cannot give a commentary in this House , I can tell him that our plans in that respect are moving forward . A stop - start approach is likely to prolong hostage captivity and increase the risk to hostages ’ lives . It also continues the relentless loss of civilians and innocent children . If the UN Security Council resolution returns with a condemnation of Hamas , will the UK do the right thing this time and back an immediate humanitarian ceasefire ? As the hon . Lady will know , not least from the urgent question asked in the House yesterday by the right hon . Member for Tottenham ( Mr Lammy ) , neither the Government nor the Opposition believe that a ceasefire is the right way to proceed . However , I can tell her that we are very heavily engaged in what is happening in these Security Council resolutions , and the Security Council permanent members were at Rafah yesterday , looking in detail at the situation on the ground . There has to be a ceasefire to protect civilians in Gaza . Does the Minister agree with the US Secretary for Defence when he said that “ protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative ” , and that “ if you drive them into the arms of the enemy , you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat ” ? Are the Government making those representations to the Israeli Government ? Of course , the position of the American Defence Secretary is exactly the position of the British Government , and that is why we say at all points that everyone must adhere international humanitarian law . The whole House is appalled by the atrocities committed by Hamas , but also by the civilian suffering in Gaza . Will my right hon . Friend set out the steps he is taking to relieve civilian suffering , and also the steps he is taking against illegal settlements and the actions of violent settlers , because they are an obstacle to the two - state solution and to a lasting and just peace ? On the first part of my hon . Friend ’ s question , I can tell him that we have delivered 74 tonnes of aid to el - Arish , which we are trying to make sure gets in . On specific relief , I can inform the House that 100 trucks and 120 , 600 litres of fuel did get across the border into Rafah yesterday .

Members will be taking part in remembrance services across the nation and overseas this weekend . Medals proudly worn by our veterans are not just thanks from a grateful nation ; they are a message for the rest of us . We should remember their service and sacrifice , but also the lessons that made their service and sacrifice both necessary and possible . This weekend , as we attend services and lay wreaths beside memorials , we should reflect on how best to honour them and the freedoms we enjoy because of them , and protect their precious legacy . The shadow Leader of the House started by talking about the cost of living . I am sorry that , as she did so , she did not recognise that this week we have paid out £2 . 2 billion in cost of living payments and that 99 % of households eligible for the cost of living payment have already received it from this Government . I disagree with the hon . Lady , because I do not think that our cost of living issues are remotely helped by lessening our energy security , which is why we are bringing forward the Bill and why I ask her party to support it . It is not at all incompatible with investing in renewable energy and clean technology . The hon . Lady is rather fond of criticising both our record and our plans for this Session , so it might be helpful to get the scores on the doors . She believes that our 43 Bills , 1 , 000 statutory instruments and record number of private Members ’ Bills — 24 — passed in the third Session of this Parliament is a shabby record . I point out to her that only in two of the 13 parliamentary Sessions between 1997 and 2010 were more Bills put through than we put through in the last Session . In the last Sessions of Labour Administrations , the average number of Bills brought forward was 21 . The hon . Lady cannot justify her charge against us about the amount we have got done . She might be relying on the time it took us — it did take us less time than we had allocated to pass a lot of that legislation and to do Government business — but that is not really a problem for those on the Government Benches ; it is a more a problem for those on the Opposition Benches , although I have no complaints about that . Those on the Government side of the House have been pulling their weight , even in Opposition day debates — in debates on school safety and animal welfare , for example , there were more Conservative speakers than Opposition speakers . Let me go into the specific points that the hon . Lady raised . On tents , the Home Secretary has no plans to ban Millets — we are not doing that . The Government have made the largest investment ever in tackling homelessness and rough sleeping , providing £2 billion to accelerate its mitigation and prevention , including preventing 640 , 000 people from becoming homeless in the last five years . On conversion therapy , we have a manifesto commitment , and it is still a manifesto commitment . The Secretary of State will keep the House informed on the work she is doing on this important matter . I was surprised to hear the hon . Lady raise nutrient neutrality . I had hoped she would support our measures , but the Secretary of State will no doubt update the House on the further work he is doing in that area .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-11-09.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-11-09.txt"}, {"score": 13.715279576181432, "chunk_id": "debates2023-12-19_F23", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-12-19.txt", "date": "2023-12-19", "parliament": "UK", "text": "If the Government again decide to abdicate their responsibility to humanity and abstain , they will be giving Netanyahu the political cover he needs to prosecute a war in which tens of thousands have already been killed and in which , at the weekend , according to the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem , “ a sniper of the IDF murdered two women inside the Holy Family Parish in Gaza . ” If the UK is unable to support a ceasefire now , when will it ? What has to happen before this Government say enough is enough , and that the indiscriminate killing of innocents , the blanket bombing of civilian infrastructure and the killing of journalists has to stop now ? How many more breaches of international humanitarian law will it take for this Government to find the moral courage to say , “ This has to stop , and it has to stop now ” ? I do not think this is an issue of moral courage . The Government , with the support of those on the Opposition Front Bench , are doing what we believe to be right . We have been very clear that Israel has a right to defend itself , but it must do more to diminish and minimise the number of civilian casualties . On the point the hon . Member made about the United Nations resolution , which we hope will be passed this afternoon , as I have said , skilled British diplomats in New York are engaged in talking throughout the United Nations to try to make sure that that resolution lands in the way both he and I want . I welcome the calls from the Foreign Secretary for a sustainable ceasefire , and I welcome my right hon . Friend ’ s words from the Dispatch Box today . Over the weekend , the Foreign Secretary received two letters , one from 10 Back Benchers on this side of the House and another from a group of foreign policy experts , calling for a permanent ceasefire . The last truce resulted in over 80 hostages being released and hundreds of lives being saved . Does my right hon . Friend accept that a permanent ceasefire would reap similar results ? It is true that the Foreign Secretary received a letter over the weekend , signed by 10 colleagues , which states : “ It is widely accepted across the world that lasting security for Israel , peace for the Palestinians , an end to the killing , and the defeat of Hamas , can only be achieved through politics and diplomacy and the establishment of two states . ” That is very much the view of the Government as well . The Minster has clearly seen the communiqué from the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem , pointing out the atrocities committed in the grounds of the Holy Family church , with two people murdered and at least seven wounded . That shows a shocking lack of fire control discipline by the Israeli forces . Will the Minister raise with the Israeli forces my grave concerns , and those of many colleagues across the House , that that is not acceptable ? There is no need for me to raise it with the Israeli forces , because they are themselves conducting an inquiry into the matter . At Gaza ’ s Kamal Adwan Hospital last weekend , approximately 80 Hamas fighters were arrested , some of whom took part in the 7 October massacres . Weaponry , Hamas intelligence , and military and technological equipment were recovered , and reports suggest that hospital staff directed the Israel Defence Forces to weapons that Hamas had stored inside incubators for premature babies .

Will he now tell us that they should be , and that the UK will support the International Criminal Court investigation , led by Andrew Cayley , to ensure not only that all allegations against all parties are investigated , but that there is accountability for those who break the law ? The hon . Lady is quite right : there needs to be a full and thorough investigation and accountability in respect of what was reported today by the BBC , and I can assure her that the Foreign Office is pressing for full transparency and accountability on that matter . But surely the Minister can see the problem . Unless the ICJ ’ s provisional ruling is implemented and the ICC is allowed to go about its work , those words are simply meaningless ; and unless the international community makes it crystal clear that rules will be upheld by all parties and those who do not uphold them will be held accountable , more people will die . Peace is built on the bedrock of international law . May I ask the Minister again to make it clear to the House that the Government will support the ICC ’ s investigation of Hamas as well as its investigation of Israel and will press for the full implementation of the ICJ ’ s provisional ruling , and that international law will be upheld not when it is convenient but always , as the precondition for peace ? Let me be very clear about this : we did not believe , and do not believe , that the ICJ referral is helpful to attempts to secure dialogue . We respect the role and independence of the ICJ and will consider any advisory opinion , but we did not think it helpful , without the consent of both parties , for the Court to deliver an advisory opinion on what is essentially a bilateral dispute . However , we keep all these matters under review and , as I have said , our current position is that we believe Israel has both the capacity and the intent to abide by international humanitarian law . I call the SNP spokesperson . The Minister will have seen the shocking images of parachutes dropping aid into Gaza at the same moment as a barrage of Israeli missiles struck . There is , of course , every chance that the aid and the missiles originated from the same source , and I wonder at the level of cognitive dissonance required to supply aid to innocent civilians while at the same time providing the means by which Israel can continue to kill them indiscriminately . When will this Government recognise the moral absurdity of selling weapons to Israel while attempting to salve their conscience by airdropping aid to those civilians who are fortunate enough to have survived the bombardment ? As I think I have mentioned to the hon . Gentleman before , in this country we have the toughest arms control mechanisms anywhere , but we accept that Israel has a right of self - defence , and this has to be seen through that prism as well as the prism through which he sees it . But I can tell him that we continually keep these matters under review — that is not only international humanitarian law , but the arms export regime — and we will continue to do so .

Today , we must think not just in terms of the threat but also in terms of the future . So , let us ask a foundational question : Why does America need nuclear weapons ? If it does , how many and what kind ? Proponents often justify nuclear weapons for two reasons : ( 1 ) to deter and fight a strategic nuclear exchange between major powers , and ( 2 ) to deter non - nuclear aggression . Focusing on the first category , deterring an opponent from using strategic and tactical nuclear weapons , history would indicate that the strategy has worked for more than 70 years . . . but that record understates how close we came to causing our own destruction . Several near - disastrous incidents motivated leaders to back away and undertake several treaties to reduce weapons and risks . Leaders like Reagan , JFK , Eisenhower , Carter , and Obama knew that nuclear weapons could end civilization and , with those heavy moral and ethical considerations in mind , negotiated significant safety measures and a serious reduction in nuclear weapons . These leaders demonstrated vision and commitment . They knew that war was not an option , so they had to create a vision for a safer future . Unfortunately , too many today shrug their shoulders and say the time for negations is not now . Which brings us to yet another question : Why not try ? Over the next 30 years , we will spend almost 2 trillion dollars on our nuclear weapons . What if we spent just 1 % on diplomatic and risk reduction efforts ? The second category of limiting non - nuclear aggression carries its own risks . Proponents of using nuclear weapons suggest that we could use ` ` tactical weapons & # x27 ; & # x27 ; in some limited way . However , once a nuclear option starts , when and how does a tactical exchange proceed ? In the chaos and fog of war , would this tactical nuclear option just open the way to full - scale devastation ? Many ` ` think tanks & # x27 ; & # x27 ; have studied this , and to this day , the result is ` ` do not open Pandora & # x27 ; s Box . & # x27 ; & # x27 ; Despite their limitations , both categories are also how we continue to justify our spending on our massive nuclear arsenal . Some even use them to justify larger and larger expenses . But this brings us to another why question : Why have we chosen to spend our defense dollars on modernizing every element in the current nuclear systems ? This question will become increasingly important as timelines slip and costs grow in our nuclear modernization programs . For example , fresh off its first Nunn - McCurdy review , the Sentinel Program will now cost at least $ 140 billion , not including a new bomb for another $ 30 billion or the unknown costs of plutonium pit production . We have an obligation to ask why . Not only ` why the extraordinary cost increases & # x27 ; , but far more importantly , why are we doing the Sentinel program at all ? Is there no alternative that would deter adversaries more effectively ? History is an important guide in this matter . In the 1950s and 1960s , our nuclear enterprise developed ground - based ICBMs , and we have continued them through the years . Today , members of Congress , without scrutiny , repeat a mantra that 400 ground - based ICBMs are necessary .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\US\\2024-08-27.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/US/2024-08-27.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["2024-08-27.txt | 2024-08-27_F18 | 2024-08-27 | US", "debates2023-11-09.txt | debates2023-11-09_F18 | 2023-11-09 | UK", "debates2023-12-12.txt | debates2023-12-12_F4 | 2023-12-12 | UK", "debates2023-12-19.txt | debates2023-12-19_F23 | 2023-12-19 | UK", "debates2024-01-30.txt | debates2024-01-30_F9 | 2024-01-30 | UK", "debates2024-03-12.txt | debates2024-03-12_F3 | 2024-03-12 | UK", "debates2024-11-26.txt | debates2024-11-26_F11 | 2024-11-26 | UK", "debates2025-05-14.txt | debates2025-05-14_F26 | 2025-05-14 | UK"], "answer": "Speakers often justify humanitarian intervention from multiple perspectives including moral duty, international law, and national interest. Here's how they typically frame their arguments:\n\n1. **Moral Duty**: Many advocates for humanitarian intervention argue that it is fundamentally a moral obligation to prevent atrocities such as genocide, war crimes, or ethnic cleansing when states fail to do so themselves. This view emphasizes the imperative of protecting innocent lives and preventing human suffering on grounds of universal principles like justice, humanity, and the rule of law.\n\n2. **International Law**: Humanitarian intervention is also justified by existing international legal frameworks that include laws such as the Geneva Conventions and various resolutions passed by international bodies like the United Nations Security Council. These documents lay out criteria for when humanitarian interventions can be deemed lawful, often requiring a clear threat or use of force against civilians, an imminent danger to the population, or a failure by the state to protect its people.\n\n3. **National Interest**: While less common in formal justifications, some proponents argue that humanitarian intervention serves national interests, such as maintaining international order, preventing future instability, and protecting investments or other economic assets at risk from conflict. This perspective often aligns with efforts to safeguard national security by ensuring regions where states are failing do not become ungoverned spaces prone to further turmoil.\n\nEach of these justifications can be combined in different ways depending on the context and goals of intervention, though moral duty is often seen as a foundational principle guiding both international law and considerations of national interest.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:02:52"}

It is important that we have a legal duty of candour and we will be introducing that , because , as she says , there must be the truth here , based on all people being dealt with on the basis of dignity , fairness and accountability . In the words of the former Israeli Prime Minister , what we are witnessing in Gaza is the “ indiscriminate , limitless , cruel and criminal killing of civilians . ” More than 50 , 000 people have been killed , and children have been shot while queuing for bread . A growing number of genocide scholars , including leading Israeli academics , believe that a genocide is taking place . Under international law , we have a duty to prevent genocide . I served on the UN mission in Kosovo . We acted to stop mass killing there . What is the difference now ? Will the Prime Minister please intervene immediately to alleviate human suffering , and take steps to recognise the state of Palestine ? My hon . Friend will have seen the statement we made yesterday and the actions that we are taking with allies . The humanitarian situation is dreadful and distressing , and the scenes that we have witnessed outside aid distribution centres are frankly heartbreaking . More aid into Gaza is needed at volume and speed , and Israel ’ s plan for aid delivery is inadequate and insufficient . What is needed is for the UN and other agencies to deliver that aid according to well - established mechanisms , and Israel must allow this . We are working with allies to do all that we can to make this happen , as well as to get the hostages out — they have been held for a very long time — and a desperately needed return to a ceasefire . There are significant concerns regarding the potential job losses at Spirit AeroSystems that stem from the deal with Airbus . Will the Prime Minister intervene to bring all the main players — the unions , the Business Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland — around the table to ensure that these jobs are protected , especially considering that the scale of the issue is akin to the challenges faced by British Steel ? There is also an issue for Northern Ireland businesses with the outworkings of the Northern Ireland protocol and the Windsor framework . Can the Prime Minister give me reassurances that he is working to resolve all those issues ? I am grateful to the hon . Member for raising this important case of Spirit AeroSystems in Northern Ireland . I know how important it is for the workforce ; I have visited them myself on more than one occasion . Airbus ’ s decision to expand UK operations is good news for the sector and testament to world - class manufacturing expertise , and I want to see those high - skilled jobs protected . The Northern Ireland Secretary has met Airbus , the trade unions and Assembly representatives to discuss the best outcome . The Minister for Industry is continuing engagement with stakeholders , and we will do everything we can in relation to this situation . I am grateful to him for raising it . Will the Prime Minister join me in condemning decisions taken by the Transport Minister of the previous Government , who turned their back on promises to deliver a new train station at Beam Park , which derailed growth in my constituency of Dagenham and Rainham ? Will he also agree that the Grampian condition on the Beam Park development must be honoured , and that infrastructure must accompany all developments of scale as we get on with the job of delivering millions of new homes ?

We also regularly raise Tibet in multilateral fora , such as in January at China ’ s universal periodic review and in March as part of our item 4 statement at the UN Human Rights Council . Many people in the Aylesbury constituency are understandably concerned about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza . They condemn the appalling actions of Hamas , but at the same time want the UK to do everything possible to get more aid in . Can my right hon . Friend let them know what further plans he has to provide more aid directly , especially with our friends in the region , including Egypt , Qatar and Jordan ? I am grateful to my hon . Friend for his thoughts and ideas , which he came and spoke to me about last week . He was conveying the views of the mosques in Aylesbury . We are pursuing many of the ideas that he set out , as he knows , especially on meeting the evident humanitarian needs that have rightly preoccupied the House today . One month since UN Security Council resolution 2728 passed with UK support , what are our Government doing to bring about the immediate ceasefire in Gaza , the compliance with international law , the release of hostages and the passage of aid that it calls for ? What are the consequences for non - compliance , apart from more death and destruction ? As the hon . Lady knows , UN resolution 2728 , which was passed on 25 March , reflected the international consensus behind the UK ’ s position about the importance of getting aid in and the hostages out . That is what we are bending every sinew to achieve . Bearing in mind Lord Cameron ’ s unique responsibility for Libya , following our intervention in that country during the Arab spring , what are the Government doing to help the Libyan Government to tackle the enormous fraud that is taking place from the sale of oil from the Libyan state oil company ? We continue to work closely with the Government in Libya . Lord Ahmad and I keep in touch on these matters , and I will update my hon . Friend further . When the International Court of Justice , almost 100 days ago , sent Israel for trial , plausibly on charges of genocide , the British Government called it a foreign court . What attitude will the Government take if , as is widely reported , the British King ’ s Counsel chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court issues an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu ? I think the hon . Gentleman is speculating in an extraordinary manner . What the Court said at the time was that the hostages should be released , that there should be more aid into Gaza and that Israel should not commit acts that violate the rights of Palestinians . That is where the Court rests at this point , and we must wait for further events . Ahead of the UN General Assembly high - level meeting on antimicrobial resistance , does my right hon . Friend agree that it is vital to build the political will of developed and developing countries to prioritise tackling AMR ? What discussions has he had with his counterparts coming up to this high - level meeting ? My hon . Friend is right . An enormous amount of work is going on in respect of AMR , which is being discussed extensively this year at the United Nations .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-30.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-30.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2024-03-14.txt | debates2024-03-14_F17 | 2024-03-14 | UK", "debates2024-04-30.txt | debates2024-04-30_F15 | 2024-04-30 | UK", "debates2025-01-07.txt | debates2025-01-07_F34 | 2025-01-07 | UK", "debates2025-05-14.txt | debates2025-05-14_F20 | 2025-05-14 | UK", "debates2025-06-11.txt | debates2025-06-11_F14 | 2025-06-11 | UK"], "answer": "Speakers justify humanitarian intervention based on a combination of moral duty and international law.

It is the UK Government ’ s long - standing position that any formal determination as to whether genocide has occurred is a matter for a competent court , not for Governments or non - judicial bodies . The UK is fully committed to upholding our responsibilities under domestic and international law , and we have at all times acted in a manner consistent with our legal obligations , including under the genocide convention . The devastation from this conflict must end . Our complete focus is on lifting Israeli restrictions on aid , on freeing the hostages , on protecting civilians and on restoring the ceasefire . We will work urgently with our allies and partners on further pressure to make Israel change course . Overnight , the UN ’ s emergency relief co - ordinator , Tom Fletcher , warned that a genocide was possible in Gaza . One in five people face starvation . The entire population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity . In Gaza , Gaza North , Deir al - Balah , Khan Yunis and Rafah , there is a risk of famine . There is one primary cause : Israel ’ s aid blockade since 2 March . The Security Council was told that civilians in Gaza have , again , been forcibly displaced and confined into ever - shrinking spaces , with 80 % of the territory either within Israeli militarised zones or under displacement orders . Israeli airstrikes on the European hospital in Gaza yesterday killed 28 people , with further reports of at least 48 deaths overnight from strikes elsewhere . Can the Minister tell us whether the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office has conducted any recent assessment of its own on the risk that the Israeli authorities are committing genocide ? Last night , the UK ’ s ambassador to the UN rightly called on Israel to lift the restrictions and ensure a return to the delivery of aid in Gaza in line with humanitarian principles and international law . But that is not enough .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-05-14.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-05-14.txt"}, {"score": 0.5050253868103027, "chunk_id": "debates2025-06-11_F14", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-06-11.txt", "date": "2025-06-11", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Lady mentions , I thank her for raising them . It is important that we have a legal duty of candour and we will be introducing that , because , as she says , there must be the truth here , based on all people being dealt with on the basis of dignity , fairness and accountability . In the words of the former Israeli Prime Minister , what we are witnessing in Gaza is the “ indiscriminate , limitless , cruel and criminal killing of civilians . ” More than 50 , 000 people have been killed , and children have been shot while queuing for bread . A growing number of genocide scholars , including leading Israeli academics , believe that a genocide is taking place . Under international law , we have a duty to prevent genocide . I served on the UN mission in Kosovo . We acted to stop mass killing there . What is the difference now ? Will the Prime Minister please intervene immediately to alleviate human suffering , and take steps to recognise the state of Palestine ? My hon . Friend will have seen the statement we made yesterday and the actions that we are taking with allies . The humanitarian situation is dreadful and distressing , and the scenes that we have witnessed outside aid distribution centres are frankly heartbreaking . More aid into Gaza is needed at volume and speed , and Israel ’ s plan for aid delivery is inadequate and insufficient . What is needed is for the UN and other agencies to deliver that aid according to well - established mechanisms , and Israel must allow this . We are working with allies to do all that we can to make this happen , as well as to get the hostages out — they have been held for a very long time — and a desperately needed return to a ceasefire . There are significant concerns regarding the potential job losses at Spirit AeroSystems that stem from the deal with Airbus . Will the Prime Minister intervene to bring all the main players — the unions , the Business Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland — around the table to ensure that these jobs are protected , especially considering that the scale of the issue is akin to the challenges faced by British Steel ? There is also an issue for Northern Ireland businesses with the outworkings of the Northern Ireland protocol and the Windsor framework . Can the Prime Minister give me reassurances that he is working to resolve all those issues ? I am grateful to the hon . Member for raising this important case of Spirit AeroSystems in Northern Ireland . I know how important it is for the workforce ; I have visited them myself on more than one occasion . Airbus ’ s decision to expand UK operations is good news for the sector and testament to world - class manufacturing expertise , and I want to see those high - skilled jobs protected . The Northern Ireland Secretary has met Airbus , the trade unions and Assembly representatives to discuss the best outcome . The Minister for Industry is continuing engagement with stakeholders , and we will do everything we can in relation to this situation . I am grateful to him for raising it . Will the Prime Minister join me in condemning decisions taken by the Transport Minister of the previous Government , who turned their back on promises to deliver a new train station at Beam Park , which derailed growth in my constituency of Dagenham and Rainham ? Will he also agree that the Grampian condition on the Beam Park development must be honoured , and that infrastructure must accompany all developments of scale as we get on with the job of delivering millions of new homes ?

The Government consistently raise human rights issues with the Chinese authorities , as I did during my visit last week , as I have mentioned . We also regularly raise Tibet in multilateral fora , such as in January at China ’ s universal periodic review and in March as part of our item 4 statement at the UN Human Rights Council . Many people in the Aylesbury constituency are understandably concerned about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza . They condemn the appalling actions of Hamas , but at the same time want the UK to do everything possible to get more aid in . Can my right hon . Friend let them know what further plans he has to provide more aid directly , especially with our friends in the region , including Egypt , Qatar and Jordan ? I am grateful to my hon . Friend for his thoughts and ideas , which he came and spoke to me about last week . He was conveying the views of the mosques in Aylesbury . We are pursuing many of the ideas that he set out , as he knows , especially on meeting the evident humanitarian needs that have rightly preoccupied the House today . One month since UN Security Council resolution 2728 passed with UK support , what are our Government doing to bring about the immediate ceasefire in Gaza , the compliance with international law , the release of hostages and the passage of aid that it calls for ? What are the consequences for non - compliance , apart from more death and destruction ? As the hon . Lady knows , UN resolution 2728 , which was passed on 25 March , reflected the international consensus behind the UK ’ s position about the importance of getting aid in and the hostages out . That is what we are bending every sinew to achieve . Bearing in mind Lord Cameron ’ s unique responsibility for Libya , following our intervention in that country during the Arab spring , what are the Government doing to help the Libyan Government to tackle the enormous fraud that is taking place from the sale of oil from the Libyan state oil company ? We continue to work closely with the Government in Libya . Lord Ahmad and I keep in touch on these matters , and I will update my hon . Friend further . When the International Court of Justice , almost 100 days ago , sent Israel for trial , plausibly on charges of genocide , the British Government called it a foreign court . What attitude will the Government take if , as is widely reported , the British King ’ s Counsel chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court issues an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu ? I think the hon . Gentleman is speculating in an extraordinary manner . What the Court said at the time was that the hostages should be released , that there should be more aid into Gaza and that Israel should not commit acts that violate the rights of Palestinians . That is where the Court rests at this point , and we must wait for further events . Ahead of the UN General Assembly high - level meeting on antimicrobial resistance , does my right hon . Friend agree that it is vital to build the political will of developed and developing countries to prioritise tackling AMR ? What discussions has he had with his counterparts coming up to this high - level meeting ? My hon . Friend is right . An enormous amount of work is going on in respect of AMR , which is being discussed extensively this year at the United Nations .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-30.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-30.txt"}, {"score": 0.49644196033477783, "chunk_id": "debates2023-11-14_F26", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-11-14.txt", "date": "2023-11-14", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Gentleman asks me about humanitarian law . Robert Mardini , the director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross , has made clear that Gaza hospitals , treating hundreds of wounded people , cannot be targeted under any circumstances . The hon . Gentleman will know that the ICRC is the guardian of international humanitarian law and the Geneva convention , and Robert Mardini has said : “ Hospitals are to be absolutely protected at all times . ” Finally , the hon . Gentleman makes a point about a political solution . I draw his attention to my final comments in my statement , about how we have to focus on that and on the two - state solution , and about the need for hope and opportunity to drive forward the politics in this dreadful situation . rose — Order . I expect to allow questions on the statement to run for about an hour , but because there are so many of the same Members wishing to speak in the debate on the King ’ s Speech , I hope we can have short questions and speedy answers . As my right hon . Friend has said , following the unprovoked slaughter of its citizens , Israel has a right to pursue and destroy the terrorist forces . It is terrible that the ordinary citizens of Gaza are paying the price for this , as Hamas would have known , but even if Israel is able to degrade and destroy the Hamas forces , the Hamas mindset will remain — a Hamas mindset that is funded and supported by Iran . Iran does not want there to be peace between Arab states and Israel because the Iranian regime does not want Israel to exist . When will the Government take firmer measures ? Members from across the House have asked when the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , for example , will be proscribed and we have never been given a good reason why it is not . What is the answer ? I hear what he says about the IRGC , and I know that he has already been in contact with the Foreign Secretary on exactly that point . I hope he will accept that we do not carry on a running commentary on issues such as proscription , but the House and the Foreign Secretary have heard what he said . I am still not clear whether the right hon . Gentleman agrees with Labour that the ICC has jurisdiction over the conduct of all parties in Gaza . If he does , then that is a very welcome change from the position of Prime Minister Boris Johnson . Will he clarify that ? I repeat what I said last week . It is not for Ministers to seek to state where the ICC has jurisdiction ; that is for the chief prosecutor . The chief prosecutor has not been silent on this matter , and I am sure he will continue to express his views . Whether we like it or not , Israel will carry on fighting until it has established control of the area from which it was attacked . The question that then arises is what happens next . If Israel simply withdraws , Hamas will reappear . At least one moderate Arab state believes that a two - state solution will have to be imposed and policed . Are the Government giving thought as to who might carry out that job ? Otherwise , the outcome that they want — a two - state solution — is wholly impracticable . My right hon . Friend is entirely right about that , and entirely right that Israel has an absolute right of self - defence in this matter .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-11-14.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-11-14.txt"}, {"score": 0.49069714546203613, "chunk_id": "debates2023-10-16_F24", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-10-16.txt", "date": "2023-10-16", "parliament": "UK", "text": "We call for the unconditional release of all hostages and urge the Government finally to proscribe as a terrorist organisation the funders of Hamas : Iran ’ s revolutionary guard . Israel unquestionably has the right to defend itself and its citizens . That means targeting Hamas , not innocent civilians , in line with international law . I am concerned about the forced evacuation of hospitals in Gaza , which means death for innocent Palestinians who will not survive being taken off life support . The World Health Organisation has said that this may be a breach of international humanitarian law , so will the Prime Minister set out what advice he has received on the matter ? Unlike Hamas , the Israeli President has said that the Israeli armed forces will operate in accordance with international law . Israel ’ s attempt to minimise civilian casualties by warning people to leave northern Gaza has been further complicated by Hamas terrorists telling the local population not to leave and instead using them as human shields . We will continue to urge Israel , as I have done when I have spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu , that while it exercises its absolute right to defend itself and ensure that such attacks can never happen again , it should take every possible precaution to minimise the impact on civilians . I call the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee . Saturday ’ s terror attack on Israel constituted crimes against humanity — crimes so heinous that they violated our understanding of the depths of human depravity . That depravity continues today , as innocents remain held hostage by Hamas terrorists and their patrons , the state of Iran . Israel has a legitimate right to self - defence and to defeat Hamas . We can support Israel and grieve with its people while recognising that how a counter - terrorism operation is conducted matters . It matters because Israel ’ s actions as a rule - of - law nation , and our words as its friend , shape our ability to be a legitimate arbiter in future conflicts and to have the right to call out abusers such as Russia . It matters because although there is an imperative to defeat Hamas in the immediate term in order to secure Israel ’ s future , how they are defeated will shape the region ’ s future , and because the people of Gaza are not Hamas — 1 . 2 million children bear no collective guilt for Hamas ’ s terror . So today I repeat my call for the creation of a special envoy for the middle east peace process . Will my right hon . Friend tell the House more about what actions are being taken to prevent conflict and loss of life on the west bank and in East Jerusalem ? When will we finally proscribe the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ? With regard specifically to the west bank , this is something about which I spoke to Mahmoud Abbas , the President of the Palestinian Authority this morning . I also spoke yesterday to His Majesty the King of Jordan . We discussed the measures that are necessary and the support the UK can provide to ensure the strong stability of the west bank . No one wants to see the situation escalate . I assure my hon . Friend that we are in active dialogue with both partners to see how we can help bring that stability to the west bank . Indeed , it is something I will also continue to discuss with Prime Minister Netanyahu . It is important that the west bank remains calm , and that is what we will help to bring about .

Does the Minister not consider that the ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court of war crimes and crimes against humanity and the consideration by the International Court of Justice of potential genocide are indications that breaches of international law might have occurred ? In any event , why are we so keen to sell arms to someone we have been pressing so hard to cease operations ? We continue to have grave concerns about the humanitarian situation on the ground , but those are not sufficient to undermine our judgment that Israel is committed to complying with international humanitarian law in general . We have already talked at length about the export licences and our controls around that . We recognise Israel has the right to defend itself . The Belgian Foreign Minister stated that Israel was engaging in “ tactics of starvation ” . Last month , the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Ireland stated : “ The use of starvation as a weapon of war is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law . ” This month , Belgium ’ s Minister of Development and Co - operation stated that Israel ’ s use of hunger as a weapon of war was “ a flagrant violation of international law ” . The Israeli Defence Minister is on record as saying : “ I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip . There will be no electricity , no food , no fuel , everything is closed . We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly ” . When will this Government wake up to the reality that innocent Palestinians are dying and take action to stop them dying from hunger and starvation ? We are working hard to get the aid in , as I have highlighted . That is critical . We are also calling out the Israeli Government , recognising that too many civilians have been killed .

The argument here is that all humanity has a shared obligation to prevent such suffering and protect vulnerable populations.\n\n2. **International Law**: Many justify humanitarian intervention on grounds established by international law, particularly the laws of war and peace (jus ad bellum and jus in bello). According to international treaties like the Geneva Conventions, states have obligations to intervene if there is a failure to do so that causes excessive suffering or violates human rights. The idea here is that adherence to these legal frameworks ensures fair and proportionate use of force.\n\n3. **National Interest**: This perspective suggests that humanitarian intervention serves national interests by upholding democratic values, enhancing security through the prevention of future conflicts, fostering regional stability, and building positive international relationships. By supporting or participating in humanitarian efforts, nations can position themselves as leaders in global governance and peacekeeping, potentially securing economic benefits, reducing refugee crises, and improving their own image.\n\nWhile these justifications often intersect, each speaker may emphasize different aspects based on the specific context and arguments they are making. For example, a politician might prioritize national interest to garner public support or secure votes by presenting humanitarian intervention as serving broader strategic goals. Conversely, a diplomat might appeal more heavily to international law when seeking approval from other states or international organizations. The moral duty argument is typically used during times of crisis or atrocities to assert immediate action.\n\nIn summary, speakers may use all three justifications depending on the context and audience they are addressing. Each perspective provides distinct advantages for different scenarios and objectives related to humanitarian intervention.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:04:46"}

At the heart of the reforms will be a complete overhaul of the appeals system — the biggest obstacle to reducing the size of the asylum system and ending hotel use . Tens of thousands of people in asylum accommodation are currently waiting for appeals , and under the current system that figure is to grow , with an average wait time already of 54 weeks . We have already funded thousands of additional sitting days this year , and the border security Bill will introduce a statutory timeframe of 24 weeks . However , we need to go further . We will introduce a new independent body to deal with immigration and asylum appeals . It will be fully independent of Government and staffed by professionally trained adjudicators , with safeguards to ensure high standards . It will be able to surge capacity as needed and to accelerate and prioritise cases , alongside new procedures to tackle repeat applications and unnecessary delays . We are also increasing detention and returns capacity , including a 1 , 000 - bed expansion at Campsfield and Haslar , with the first tranche of additional beds coming online within months to support many thousands more enforced removals each year . Our reforms will also address the overly complex system for family migration , including changes to the way that article 8 of the ECHR is interpreted . We should be clear that international law is important . It is because other countries know that we abide by international law that we have been able to make new agreements with France , to return people who arrive on small boats , and with Germany , to stop the warehousing of small boats by criminal gangs , and it is why we have been able to explore return hubs partnerships with other European countries . However , we need the interpretation of international law to keep up with the realities and challenges of today ’ s world . There is one area where we need to make more immediate changes . The current rules for family reunion for refugees were designed many years ago to help families separated by war , conflict and persecution , but the way they are used has now changed . Even just before the pandemic , refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average more than one or two years after they had been granted protection , which was long enough for them to get jobs , find housing and be able to provide their family with some support . In Denmark and Switzerland , those who are granted humanitarian protection are currently not able to apply to bring family for at least two years after protection has been granted . However , in the UK those family applications now come in , on average , around a month after protection has been granted , often even before a newly granted refugee has left asylum accommodation . As a consequence , refugee families who arrive are far more likely to seek homelessness assistance . Some councils are finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion . That is not sustainable . Currently , there are also no conditions on family reunion for refugee sponsors , unlike those in place if the sponsor is a British citizen or long - term UK resident . That is not fair . The proportion of migrants who have arrived on small boats and then applied to bring family has also increased sharply in recent years , with signs that smuggler gangs are now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journeys to the UK .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-01.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-01.txt"}, {"score": 38.09785032746266, "chunk_id": "debates2023-07-03_F8", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-07-03.txt", "date": "2023-07-03", "parliament": "UK", "text": "What recent assessment she has made of the compatibility of the Illegal Migration Bill with the 1951 UN refugee convention .

The Government take our international obligations very seriously and we are satisfied that the provisions in the Illegal Migration Bill comply with the refugee convention . The fundamental principle remains , however , that those in need of protection should claim asylum at the earliest opportunity and in the first safe country that they reach . The Home Secretary and the Government website say that they are satisfied that the provisions of the Illegal Migration Bill comply with the 1951 UN refugee convention . I am looking for clarity from the Home Secretary . What exactly is it about persecuting the most vulnerable groups , creating a hostile environment and stripping people of their right to seek safety that complies so well with the UN refugee convention ? As I have made clear , we take our international obligations very seriously , and we are satisfied that the Bill complies with the refugee convention . With respect to the hon . Lady , I will not take lectures from the SNP on this matter . SNP Members are , as my right hon . Friend the Member for Newark ( Robert Jenrick ) said , the phoney humanitarians in this debate . They are happy to support asylum seekers as long as they are nowhere near Scotland . When they stop opposing the vessel in Leith , which will house more asylum seekers , then we can have a serious conversation . The UN Refugee Agency has its own asylum seeker relocation programme : it flies asylum seekers from Libya to Rwanda in a scheme part - funded by the European Union . How on earth can Rwanda be deemed not to be a safe country if the UN Refugee Agency itself is using it as a safe haven ? As always , my hon . Friend makes a powerful point , and I could not agree with him more . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees runs an extensive scheme in Rwanda , and supports the resettlement of many thousands of migrants . I met some of them in my recent visit to Rwanda . They are happy and grateful for the generosity and welcome that Rwanda has offered them , which has allowed them to restart their lives . I am frankly very disappointed by the constant smears and assumptions , which are based on outdated and ignorant views , denigrating our allies in Rwanda . I am nothing but grateful to our partners in Rwanda for the continued co - operation . What steps she is taking to tackle street crime by young people . I am pleased to report that , according to the crime survey , violence is down by 41 % and criminal damage is down by 68 % since 2010 . But we would like to do more . That is why we now have record numbers of police and why we are investing in the safer streets fund , £200 million in the Youth Endowment Fund and £170 million in violence reduction units . We have also launched our antisocial behaviour strategy , about which the Home Secretary will speak in a moment . Now is a good time to put on the record an intervention made by Mr Speaker in his capacity as the Member of Parliament for Chorley .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-07-03.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-07-03.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2023-07-03.txt | debates2023-07-03_F7 | 2023-07-03 | UK", "debates2023-07-03.txt | debates2023-07-03_F8 | 2023-07-03 | UK", "debates2025-09-01.txt | debates2025-09-01_F22 | 2025-09-01 | UK"], "answer": "The context does not contain this information.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:05:33"}

Even just before the pandemic , refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average more than one or two years after they had been granted protection , which was long enough for them to get jobs , find housing and be able to provide their family with some support . In Denmark and Switzerland , those who are granted humanitarian protection are currently not able to apply to bring family for at least two years after protection has been granted . However , in the UK those family applications now come in , on average , around a month after protection has been granted , often even before a newly granted refugee has left asylum accommodation . As a consequence , refugee families who arrive are far more likely to seek homelessness assistance . Some councils are finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion . That is not sustainable . Currently , there are also no conditions on family reunion for refugee sponsors , unlike those in place if the sponsor is a British citizen or long - term UK resident . That is not fair .

That is why I have been engaging on a protective security review not just for the Government , but for all Members of this House , and for other elected officials around our country . It is completely wrong for our democracy to be silenced by anyone , and it certainly should not be silenced by cowards . My constituent , Dr Lubna Hadoura , has given almost 30 years of service in a specialised role to our NHS . Today , all she can think about is her 84 - year - old mum and other members of her family who are stuck in Gaza with no hope of escape . Will the Secretary of State agree to meet urgently with me and Dr Hadoura so that she can set out to him more powerfully than I ever could the urgent humanitarian and moral imperative to get the families of UK citizens out of Gaza before it is too late ? The Government have a duty to British nationals , which we take very seriously . I recognise the plight of many non - British nationals in Gaza , which is why , in my previous role and now supporting the current Foreign Secretary , we have long pushed for a humanitarian pause . I am pleased that that is in place . We will continue to work with the international community and the countries in the region to ensure that support is given to the people in Gaza who need it and that action is taken to end this conflict , so that Israelis as well as the Palestinian people can live in peace and security .

I give the House a categoric assurance that that will always underpin our thinking with regard to what future changes we might make to the legal migration processes .

Failing that , will he simply devolve the powers so that the Scottish Parliament can act , as it has done on air weapons and drink - driving ? I thank the hon . Gentleman for that important point .

My constituency is a diverse and welcoming place . We have a long and proud history of migrants from around the world coming to work and contribute to our community , and we have a proud history of welcoming refugees fleeing persecution and abuse . That compassion is part of who we are as a country , but our compassion must always come alongside control and a system that is fair . That is why my constituents are right to be angry about illegal crossings . When the last Government lost control of our borders , it risked lives and undermined our national security , and meant that people could cheat the system . It also meant that millions of pounds were being spent unnecessarily while our public services were on their knees . Enough is enough . This Government are determined to secure our borders . Whereas the Conservative party chose the path of sounding tough but failing to deliver , since the election this Government have rolled up their sleeves . Whereas the Conservative party picked fights with France , we have made landmark deals with international partners . Whereas the Conservative party spent nearly £9 million a day on hotels for asylum seekers , we have restarted processing to save the taxpayer £4 billion a year over the next two years , and to end the use of hotels . Whereas the Conservative party spent years pursuing the fiction of the Rwanda scheme to send a sum total of four volunteers , on our watch 32 charter flights have returned migrants across the world , enforced returns are up by 24 % on the year before the election , and our streets have been made safer through the removal of 2 , 500 foreign criminals . The Bill before us does two really important things . First , it removes from the statute book the fallacy of the Rwanda scheme — the so - called deterrent that saw 84 , 000 people cross the channel between the day it was announced and the day it was scrapped . Secondly , the Bill removes a hodgepodge of unenacted and unworkable clauses , whose sole purpose in law is to act as a monument to Conservative failure . Most importantly , this Bill delivers a range of counter - terror - style powers that I believe will enable us systematically to dismantle the vile criminal gangs who facilitate small boat crossings and risk lives . It introduces new offences , so that we can use every tool possible to put gang leaders away ; new powers to seize devices , check biometrics and share data ; and a new role for our new Border Security Command , so that we can ensure that all agencies work together . No more empty rhetoric ; instead , a common - sense , intelligence - led approach to border security . We are taking down the gangs and building the international relationships that we need to regain control . We have turbocharged our asylum system so that we can return people with no right to be here and allow those granted asylum the chance to work and contribute . A real plan . No more empty rhetoric from the Conservatives or Reform ; these are concrete steps to secure our borders , and I will be proud to vote for Second Reading today . I am grateful for the hon .

The SNP argues that accommodating more refugees is important, as Scotland makes up a significant portion of the UK population and has local authorities where fewer than one in ten people are accommodated as refugees (Clackmannanshire, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, Midlothian, North Ayrshire, and North Lanarkshire). They suggest that Glasgow takes more asylum seekers per capita than any other UK local authority. The SNP criticizes the current government for not accommodating more refugees when they arrive and instead burdening taxpayers with costs.\n\nIn contrast, the Home Secretary highlights the Government's stance on compliance with the UN Refugee Convention and their satisfaction that the Illegal Migration Bill complies with it. They emphasize the importance of individuals claiming asylum in the first safe country they reach and address criticisms about Rwanda as a safe haven for refugees by pointing out the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' scheme in Rwanda, where many thousands of migrants are supported and happy.\n\nAdditionally, there is discussion regarding economic migrants and whether their right to remain should be maintained. The Home Secretary asserts that current rules will continue to root out economic migrants, ensuring fair selection of those who contribute positively to the economy.\n\nOverall, the arguments revolve around striking a balance between upholding border control measures essential for national security and maintaining humanitarian responsibilities towards refugees and asylum seekers.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:06:12"}

My constituency is a diverse and welcoming place . We have a long and proud history of migrants from around the world coming to work and contribute to our community , and we have a proud history of welcoming refugees fleeing persecution and abuse . That compassion is part of who we are as a country , but our compassion must always come alongside control and a system that is fair . That is why my constituents are right to be angry about illegal crossings . When the last Government lost control of our borders , it risked lives and undermined our national security , and meant that people could cheat the system . It also meant that millions of pounds were being spent unnecessarily while our public services were on their knees . Enough is enough . This Government are determined to secure our borders . Whereas the Conservative party chose the path of sounding tough but failing to deliver , since the election this Government have rolled up their sleeves . Whereas the Conservative party picked fights with France , we have made landmark deals with international partners . Whereas the Conservative party spent nearly £9 million a day on hotels for asylum seekers , we have restarted processing to save the taxpayer £4 billion a year over the next two years , and to end the use of hotels . Whereas the Conservative party spent years pursuing the fiction of the Rwanda scheme to send a sum total of four volunteers , on our watch 32 charter flights have returned migrants across the world , enforced returns are up by 24 % on the year before the election , and our streets have been made safer through the removal of 2 , 500 foreign criminals . The Bill before us does two really important things . First , it removes from the statute book the fallacy of the Rwanda scheme — the so - called deterrent that saw 84 , 000 people cross the channel between the day it was announced and the day it was scrapped . Secondly , the Bill removes a hodgepodge of unenacted and unworkable clauses , whose sole purpose in law is to act as a monument to Conservative failure . Most importantly , this Bill delivers a range of counter - terror - style powers that I believe will enable us systematically to dismantle the vile criminal gangs who facilitate small boat crossings and risk lives . It introduces new offences , so that we can use every tool possible to put gang leaders away ; new powers to seize devices , check biometrics and share data ; and a new role for our new Border Security Command , so that we can ensure that all agencies work together . No more empty rhetoric ; instead , a common - sense , intelligence - led approach to border security . We are taking down the gangs and building the international relationships that we need to regain control . We have turbocharged our asylum system so that we can return people with no right to be here and allow those granted asylum the chance to work and contribute . A real plan . No more empty rhetoric from the Conservatives or Reform ; these are concrete steps to secure our borders , and I will be proud to vote for Second Reading today . I am grateful for the hon . Member ’ s question — it is a good one .

Has the Minister made an assessment of the success of the new national rural crime unit in improving police contacts with victims of rural theft ?

The commitments in the drugs strategy are being delivered , including investing more than £300 million in additional treatment capacity to create over 50 , 000 extra treatment places . We are also enforcing hard , such as by closing down more than 2 , 000 county lines since 2019 . Local police in and around Weston - super - Mare have had notable successes in disrupting drug dealing and supply , but new dealers quickly take the place of the old ones . The quantity of drugs and the number of addicts are not declining . Does the Minister accept that although enforcement and education are vital , they are not enough to solve this problem on their own , and that the underlying legal frameworks we use to control these dangerous chemicals have to be addressed , too ? Enforcement is important . Besides closing down those 2 , 000 county lines , Border Force seized about 19 tonnes of cocaine in the year ending March 2022 — the largest amount seized in a single year on record . I have already mentioned treatment . The most important thing is to get people out of their addiction entirely , which is why we are investing so much extra money in treatment . There are no plans to change the legal framework . Drugs are illegal for a reason . They are highly addictive and harmful , and the out - of - control public drug consumption in those jurisdictions that have liberalised significantly , such as California , San Francisco and so on , is not something we want to see in this country .

Although I recognise that the use of facial recognition technology can lead to more offenders being caught , does the Minister accept that deployment of a permanent network of fixed cameras across Croydon represents a significant escalation in their use , which makes it all the more important that a clear legislative framework governing their use is debated and approved by Parliament ? I fully accept that there is a need to consider live facial recognition . At the moment the law governing the use of that technology comes from various different things — human rights and equalities legislation , and other measures — and we want to see whether that should be brought together . That is why I have been having a series of meetings over the last few months . As I said , we will set out our plans for live facial recognition in the coming months . Harlow police department ’ s recent successful trial of facial recognition has led to some arrests . Does the Minister agree that technology can play a vital part in tackling crime but cannot be a substitute for neighbourhood policing ? Yes , I agree with my hon . Friend . That is why we have committed to neighbourhood policing and 13 , 000 additional police officers and PCSOs on all our high streets and in communities up and down the land . Whether she has received legal advice on the compatibility of recent changes to her Department ’ s guidance entitled “ Good character : caseworker guidance ” , updated on 10 February 2025 , with the 1951 refugee convention . The hon . Member will know that we take our international obligations very seriously . We are satisfied that the good character policy is compliant with those obligations . We have strengthened our policy to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally , including small boat arrivals , will normally be refused British citizenship . The good character assessment has been a feature of UK immigration law since 1981 and there has never been any suggestion , either now or in the past , that it is inconsistent with our obligations under the refugee convention or any other treaty . One of the most shocking and egregious things this Government have done is impose a blanket ban on British citizenship for all individuals who have entered the UK irregularly , without any parliamentary scrutiny or public consultation , effectively disenfranchising all asylum seekers and refugees , including those who have made this country their home for years . The Refugee Council estimates that up to 71 , 000 refugees who have already been granted asylum could now be blocked from securing naturalisation . The Minister knows that there are no safe routes to get to the UK , so nearly all asylum seekers have to arrive irregularly . Surely the policy clearly breaches article 31 of the 1951 refugee convention , which prohibits penalising those seeking protection for their mode of entry ? [ Interruption . ] Order . All Members should be respectful and mindful of their language at all times . Now we need to hear the Minister respond . I thank the hon . Member for his question . He will know that we explained when making the changes that each citizenship application will continue to be considered on a case - by - case basis , and that the Secretary of State may choose to apply discretion to grant citizenship on an exceptional basis where there has been particularly exceptional or mitigating circumstances , such as modern slavery .

Israel needs to ensure that its campaign is targeted on Hamas leaders and operatives , fulfils its obligations to protect civilians and is consistent with international humanitarian law . No one wants to see this conflict go on for a moment longer than necessary . That is why the United Kingdom played a leading role in securing the passage of UN Security Council resolution 2720 , which made clear the urgent demand for expanded humanitarian access . The resolution also called for the release of hostages and for steps towards a sustainable ceasefire , for which the British Government have consistently led calls . Britain has been pushing a number of innovative and impactful approaches — especially , but not only , maritime delivery — to support aid for Gaza . We are focused on the bigger picture and longer - term strategic value . UK Ministers are lobbying the Government of Israel hard and regularly to allow more aid in and reduce the numerous constraints that are hindering many aspects of our and others ’ efforts to help Gazan civilians . We have appointed Mark Bryson - Richardson as our representative for humanitarian affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territories . Last week , a Royal Navy vessel delivered 87 tonnes of life - saving UK and Cypriot aid , destined for Gaza , into Egypt . We have also supported the United Nations World Food Programme to deliver a new humanitarian land corridor from Jordan into Gaza . Seven hundred and fifty tonnes of life - saving food aid arrived in the first delivery and a second convoy , with 315 tonnes of critical supplies , reached Gaza last week , partly funded by the United Kingdom . Nevertheless , the risk of famine is stark , and the Foreign Secretary and other Ministers throughout the Government are pushing the need to address this with the Israeli Government . The Government are urging all sides to avoid further escalation . The situation is fragile and an escalation in violence , including on Lebanon ’ s southern border with Israel , is not in anyone ’ s interests . In the Red sea , the Houthis ’ attacks against commercial shipping are patently unacceptable . We have already taken action to deter Houthi threats , and we will not hesitate to take further action as needed . There is no perfect formula for peace . What I can say is that Gaza should ultimately be under Palestinian control , and we support a two - state solution that guarantees security and stability for both Israeli and Palestinian people . Mr Speaker , the Christmas period has not brought peace to the middle east . There has been no let - up to the intolerable suffering in Gaza and no end to the cruelty for hostages . Millions are displaced , desperate and hungry . Israel continues to use devastating tactics that have seen far too many innocent civilians killed , with unacceptable blocks on essential aid , nowhere safe for civilians , a growing humanitarian catastrophe , and now warnings of a deadly famine . Meanwhile , Hamas terrorists continue to hold hostages , hide among civilians and fire rockets into Israel . This dire situation must not continue . The need for a sustained ceasefire is clear . The fighting must stop urgently . We need a humanitarian truce now — not as a short pause but as the first step towards what will stop the killing of innocents , provide urgent humanitarian relief , ward off famine , free hostages and provide the space for a sustainable ceasefire so that fighting does not restart .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-01-08.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-01-08.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2023-07-03.txt | debates2023-07-03_F7 | 2023-07-03 | UK", "debates2023-07-03.txt | debates2023-07-03_F8 | 2023-07-03 | UK", "debates2023-11-27.txt | debates2023-11-27_F15 | 2023-11-27 | UK", "debates2024-01-08.txt | debates2024-01-08_F19 | 2024-01-08 | UK", "debates2024-01-15.txt | debates2024-01-15_F4 | 2024-01-15 | UK", "debates2025-02-10.txt | debates2025-02-10_F0 | 2025-02-10 | UK", "debates2025-03-31.txt | debates2025-03-31_F12 | 2025-03-31 | UK", "debates2025-09-01.txt | debates2025-09-01_F22 | 2025-09-01 | UK"], "answer": "The document discusses several key arguments in balancing border control measures with humanitarian obligations:\n\n1. **Deportation of Irregular Migrants**: The UK government is committed to deporting individuals who enter the country irregularly, but they insist this does not breach their international obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention. They maintain that each citizenship application will continue to be considered on a case-by-case basis and that the Secretary of State may choose to apply discretion in granting citizenship where there has been particularly exceptional or mitigating circumstances.\n\n2. **Facial Recognition Technology**: There is discussion about whether deployment of permanent fixed cameras for facial recognition represents a significant escalation, which necessitates clear legislative frameworks governing their use and debate within Parliament. The Minister acknowledges the need to consider live facial recognition technology and to bring together various existing laws into one clear framework.\n\n3. **Hotel Use for Asylum Seekers**: There is an ongoing effort to reduce or eliminate the use of hotels as temporary accommodation for asylum seekers, which has been a subject of both criticism (for not respecting asylum seekers' privacy) and acknowledgment that it's necessary due to housing shortages in the UK.\n\n4. **Refugee Citizenship Restrictions**: The document highlights a controversial government policy where individuals who enter the UK irregularly will generally be refused British citizenship, effectively disenfranchising many refugees who have made their home there for years. Critics argue this policy clearly breaches article 31 of the 1951 Refugee Convention, which prohibits penalizing those seeking protection for their mode of entry.\n\nIn summary, the document presents a nuanced approach to balancing stringent border control policies with some humanitarian considerations, such as reducing hotel use and considering individual cases for citizenship applications. However, these measures are framed within an overall framework that prioritizes enforcement and deterrence against irregular migration, even when it conflicts with certain legal obligations or human rights standards.\n\nThe core arguments in favor of strict border control include maintaining national security and resource allocation priorities, while critics argue these policies disproportionately impact refugees and asylum seekers who find themselves unable to enter the UK legally.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:07:15"}

The Minister commits to discussing these issues with the Republic of Ireland to find solutions.\n\n- Egypt is mentioned as an important partner in ensuring legitimate refugees do not pose a threat to states like theirs. Efforts are being made through dialogue and collaboration with local partners including the Egyptian Red Crescent and UN agencies to provide aid.\n\n- The Labour party suggests that their government had lost control over borders and faced issues related to asylum, but this is countered by the current government's claim of restoring order in the asylum system. They state an increase in decision making productivity and a goal to cut back on those without right to be here more swiftly than previous administrations.\n\n- The shadow Home Secretary highlights statistics showing reductions in overall crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) since 2019, claiming that these measures have resulted in fewer people waiting years for their asylum applications to be processed.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:07:52"}

Ms Ferguson , is there an actual question ? There certainly is . Is my hon . Friend able to give a timeline for her decision making ? I understand the heightened anxiety among Syrian asylum seekers , but the Home Office relies on the country information in order to make decisions on whether particular people need protection , and that information is currently in the middle of quite profound change .

Will she now do a U - turn and implement a removals deterrent so that all illegal arrivals are rapidly removed to a safe third country ? Some 84 , 000 people crossed the channel from the day the Rwandan deal was signed to the day it was scrapped . The Conservatives failed to deter a single boat or deport a single person . Instead , they spent £700 million and sent four people — four failed asylum seekers — to start a new life in Kigali with free housing , free private healthcare and free university education , at a cost of £150 , 000 each . If the right hon .

At the heart of the reforms will be a complete overhaul of the appeals system — the biggest obstacle to reducing the size of the asylum system and ending hotel use . Tens of thousands of people in asylum accommodation are currently waiting for appeals , and under the current system that figure is to grow , with an average wait time already of 54 weeks . We have already funded thousands of additional sitting days this year , and the border security Bill will introduce a statutory timeframe of 24 weeks . However , we need to go further . We will introduce a new independent body to deal with immigration and asylum appeals . It will be fully independent of Government and staffed by professionally trained adjudicators , with safeguards to ensure high standards . It will be able to surge capacity as needed and to accelerate and prioritise cases , alongside new procedures to tackle repeat applications and unnecessary delays . We are also increasing detention and returns capacity , including a 1 , 000 - bed expansion at Campsfield and Haslar , with the first tranche of additional beds coming online within months to support many thousands more enforced removals each year . Our reforms will also address the overly complex system for family migration , including changes to the way that article 8 of the ECHR is interpreted . We should be clear that international law is important . It is because other countries know that we abide by international law that we have been able to make new agreements with France , to return people who arrive on small boats , and with Germany , to stop the warehousing of small boats by criminal gangs , and it is why we have been able to explore return hubs partnerships with other European countries . However , we need the interpretation of international law to keep up with the realities and challenges of today ’ s world . There is one area where we need to make more immediate changes . The current rules for family reunion for refugees were designed many years ago to help families separated by war , conflict and persecution , but the way they are used has now changed . Even just before the pandemic , refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average more than one or two years after they had been granted protection , which was long enough for them to get jobs , find housing and be able to provide their family with some support . In Denmark and Switzerland , those who are granted humanitarian protection are currently not able to apply to bring family for at least two years after protection has been granted . However , in the UK those family applications now come in , on average , around a month after protection has been granted , often even before a newly granted refugee has left asylum accommodation . As a consequence , refugee families who arrive are far more likely to seek homelessness assistance . Some councils are finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion . That is not sustainable . Currently , there are also no conditions on family reunion for refugee sponsors , unlike those in place if the sponsor is a British citizen or long - term UK resident . That is not fair . The proportion of migrants who have arrived on small boats and then applied to bring family has also increased sharply in recent years , with signs that smuggler gangs are now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journeys to the UK .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-01.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-01.txt"}, {"score": 0.6246795654296875, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-06_F25", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-06.txt", "date": "2024-11-06", "parliament": "UK", "text": "168 . ] How did that go ? In 2018 , 400 crossed the channel . Since then , more than 140 , 000 have crossed , the majority of them on the Conservatives ’ watch . All they could introduce were ridiculous gimmicks , such as Rwanda , which cost taxpayers millions of pounds . Does the Minister agree that the new injection of cash into border security command is a better use of taxpayers ’ money than the gimmicks that the Conservatives introduced ? Yes , I agree wholeheartedly . The issue here is dealing with cross - border organised immigration crime . To do that , we have to talk to our international allies and co - operate with them across borders . That is exactly what the creation of the border security command will do , both operationally and politically , and we will see the results . We now come to the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . I join the Minister in welcoming the new shadow Home Secretary to his place . Leading with the chin on the first full day in the job is an interesting approach , but if any situation highlights the manifest failings of the last Conservative Government , it is surely this . We in this House all want to stop the dangerous channel crossings . I am afraid that the last Government totally failed at that , so I am surprised we are discussing it today . The asylum backlog ballooned under the Tories . The human beings we are talking about who are in these small boats are often the victims of smuggling and trafficking gangs that profit from human suffering . Does the Minister agree that it is therefore imperative that we work in closer co - ordination than ever before with Europol and our French counterparts to smash these criminal networks ? I urge the Government to address the root causes of the problem , not just the symptoms . We must empower the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office to provide robust aid to regions in an increasingly unstable world . The hon . Lady is exactly right . This is not about gimmicks , or having a parallel immigration policy that is unconnected with any of the treaties we have signed or international law ; it is about doing the day job , and making sure not to leave an inheritor Government a 200 , 000 - person backlog by not doing the day job . The issue with small boat crossings is dealing with organised , internationally focused immigration crime , which often originates in countries very far away . To tackle this issue , we have to co - operate with the forces of law and order operationally , across borders , and that is what this Government are determined to do . May I welcome the Government ’ s approach on this issue , and the 23 % increase in enforced removals since last summer ? I agree with the Minister that the way to deal with this issue is to smash the criminal gangs .

Ms Ferguson , is there an actual question ? There certainly is . Is my hon . Friend able to give a timeline for her decision making ? I understand the heightened anxiety among Syrian asylum seekers , but the Home Office relies on the country information in order to make decisions on whether particular people need protection , and that information is currently in the middle of quite profound change . When we are in a position to make decisions against new , more up - to - date information , we will certainly do so . I hope the Syrian community will be patient and not too anxious about the pause currently in place . How many hotels in Scotland are used to house asylum seekers ? We do not comment on where hotels are , but I can tell the hon . Gentleman that there are 216 hotels across the whole country . We will be getting those numbers down as quickly as we can . I call the shadow Home Secretary . Many seeking asylum , including from Syria , enter the UK by illegally crossing the channel , which is , of course , completely unnecessary , as France is a safe country with a well - functioning asylum system . In relation to those channel crossings , will the Minister accept that the Government ’ s plan to smash the gangs lies in tatters ? Crossings are up by 31 % since the election — they are about to break 300 , 000 [ Official Report , 31 March 2025 ; Vol . 765 , c . 25 . ] ( Correction ) — and the first three months of this year have been the worst on record . Does the Minister accept it was a catastrophic mistake to cancel the Rwanda deterrent before it even started ? I was in Berlin last week , and the new German Government , and other European Governments , are looking to implement removals deterrents very similar to the Rwanda deterrent . Will she now do a U - turn and implement a removals deterrent so that all illegal arrivals are rapidly removed to a safe third country ? Some 84 , 000 people crossed the channel from the day the Rwandan deal was signed to the day it was scrapped . The Conservatives failed to deter a single boat or deport a single person . Instead , they spent £700 million and sent four people — four failed asylum seekers — to start a new life in Kigali with free housing , free private healthcare and free university education , at a cost of £150 , 000 each . If the right hon . Gentleman really thinks that paying £150 , 000 per removed asylum seeker was an adequate answer to the challenge of small boat crossings , then I do not know what planet he is living on . What steps her Department is taking with police forces to tackle violence against women and girls . I join the Immigration Minister in wishing Mr Speaker well for his important trip to Ukraine .

At the heart of the reforms will be a complete overhaul of the appeals system — the biggest obstacle to reducing the size of the asylum system and ending hotel use . Tens of thousands of people in asylum accommodation are currently waiting for appeals , and under the current system that figure is to grow , with an average wait time already of 54 weeks . We have already funded thousands of additional sitting days this year , and the border security Bill will introduce a statutory timeframe of 24 weeks . However , we need to go further . We will introduce a new independent body to deal with immigration and asylum appeals . It will be fully independent of Government and staffed by professionally trained adjudicators , with safeguards to ensure high standards . It will be able to surge capacity as needed and to accelerate and prioritise cases , alongside new procedures to tackle repeat applications and unnecessary delays . We are also increasing detention and returns capacity , including a 1 , 000 - bed expansion at Campsfield and Haslar , with the first tranche of additional beds coming online within months to support many thousands more enforced removals each year . Our reforms will also address the overly complex system for family migration , including changes to the way that article 8 of the ECHR is interpreted . We should be clear that international law is important . It is because other countries know that we abide by international law that we have been able to make new agreements with France , to return people who arrive on small boats , and with Germany , to stop the warehousing of small boats by criminal gangs , and it is why we have been able to explore return hubs partnerships with other European countries . However , we need the interpretation of international law to keep up with the realities and challenges of today ’ s world . There is one area where we need to make more immediate changes . The current rules for family reunion for refugees were designed many years ago to help families separated by war , conflict and persecution , but the way they are used has now changed . Even just before the pandemic , refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average more than one or two years after they had been granted protection , which was long enough for them to get jobs , find housing and be able to provide their family with some support . In Denmark and Switzerland , those who are granted humanitarian protection are currently not able to apply to bring family for at least two years after protection has been granted . However , in the UK those family applications now come in , on average , around a month after protection has been granted , often even before a newly granted refugee has left asylum accommodation . As a consequence , refugee families who arrive are far more likely to seek homelessness assistance . Some councils are finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion . That is not sustainable . Currently , there are also no conditions on family reunion for refugee sponsors , unlike those in place if the sponsor is a British citizen or long - term UK resident . That is not fair . The proportion of migrants who have arrived on small boats and then applied to bring family has also increased sharply in recent years , with signs that smuggler gangs are now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journeys to the UK .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-01.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-01.txt"}, {"score": 0.6246795654296875, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-06_F25", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-06.txt", "date": "2024-11-06", "parliament": "UK", "text": "168 . ] How did that go ?

Does the Minister agree that the new injection of cash into border security command is a better use of taxpayers ’ money than the gimmicks that the Conservatives introduced ? Yes , I agree wholeheartedly . The issue here is dealing with cross - border organised immigration crime . To do that , we have to talk to our international allies and co - operate with them across borders . That is exactly what the creation of the border security command will do , both operationally and politically , and we will see the results . We now come to the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . I join the Minister in welcoming the new shadow Home Secretary to his place . Leading with the chin on the first full day in the job is an interesting approach , but if any situation highlights the manifest failings of the last Conservative Government , it is surely this . We in this House all want to stop the dangerous channel crossings . I am afraid that the last Government totally failed at that , so I am surprised we are discussing it today . The asylum backlog ballooned under the Tories . The human beings we are talking about who are in these small boats are often the victims of smuggling and trafficking gangs that profit from human suffering . Does the Minister agree that it is therefore imperative that we work in closer co - ordination than ever before with Europol and our French counterparts to smash these criminal networks ? I urge the Government to address the root causes of the problem , not just the symptoms . We must empower the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office to provide robust aid to regions in an increasingly unstable world . The hon . Lady is exactly right . This is not about gimmicks , or having a parallel immigration policy that is unconnected with any of the treaties we have signed or international law ; it is about doing the day job , and making sure not to leave an inheritor Government a 200 , 000 - person backlog by not doing the day job . The issue with small boat crossings is dealing with organised , internationally focused immigration crime , which often originates in countries very far away . To tackle this issue , we have to co - operate with the forces of law and order operationally , across borders , and that is what this Government are determined to do .

Tragically , since this Government came to office 50 people have lost their lives or gone missing — more than in the previous 18 months put together — and , tragically , that includes 16 women and children . This Government decided — they chose — to cancel the Rwanda scheme before it had even started . The first flight was due to take off , from memory , on 24 July but they cancelled it . Had they allowed that to go ahead and the scheme to continue , the deterrent effect would by now have started . We know it works , because it worked in Australia under its Operation Sovereign Borders about 10 years ago . We know the deterrent effect of returns works : it worked with Albania where we secured a 93 % reduction in arrivals . Do not just take my word for it : the National Crime Agency said that law enforcement alone is not enough and we need an effective removal scheme to deter crossings . The Government ’ s announcements in Glasgow on Monday are simply not enough , and they repeat work that is under way already . The NCA and I are not the only ones saying that we need a returns deterrent . Just a few weeks ago , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen encouraged member states to develop their own returns hubs outside the European Union . Will the Minister follow Ursula von der Leyen ’ s advice and urgently implement offshore processing ? May I also draw attention to the success that Belgium has had in stopping boats by the shore ? Will the Minister ask France to do the same ? Finally , because of their failings Labour are breaking their manifesto pledge to end hotel use , so will she pledge not to open any more hotels ?

What a pleasure it is to be opposite him ; I am going to look forward to jousting with him over the years . On the Rwanda scheme , during the period from when it began to when we scrapped it , 83 , 500 people crossed in small boats . If that is a deterrent , the right hon . Gentleman has a peculiar view of the meaning of “ deterrence ” in the English language . When I realised that we were doing this urgent question , I took the opportunity to look at the right hon . Gentleman ’ s record as a Home Office Minister . During his first stint at the Home Office — from September 2019 to 2021 — 23 , 849 people crossed the channel on small boats . During his second ministerial sojourn at the Home Office , 50 , 637 people crossed the channel in small boats , so his overall total is 74 , 486 . In September 2020 , the shadow Home Secretary answered an urgent question . He said that the last Government would “ not rest until we have taken the necessary steps to completely end these crossings . ” — [ Official Report , 2 September 2020 ; Vol . 679 , c . 168 . ] How did that go ?

We also support the suspension of asylum processing ; I am glad that the Government made that decision a few hours after I called for it yesterday . Does the Home Secretary agree that , given that most if not all the asylum claims are predicated on the threat posed to the individual by former President Assad , now that that threat has gone and the basis for the asylum claims has therefore gone , it would be reasonable to ask Syrians who are claiming or have recently been granted asylum on that basis to return once they are safe ? Earlier today , the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister if he would ensure that no former UK residents who are in Syria and who supported the murderous Daesh regime that killed and raped innocent women and children , persecuted minorities and severely persecuted its opponents return to the UK . In government , the Conservatives ensured that those people did not return — the Shamima Begum case was an example — so will the Home Secretary take similarly robust action to ensure that people who supported Daesh do not return to the United Kingdom ? I think the House would appreciate such an assurance . Let me now turn to the question of small boats and border security . The Home Secretary asserted , I must say rather boldly , that her approach was “ delivering results ” , but I am afraid the facts do not bear that out . Let us have a look at the results that are actually being delivered . In the 150 days since the election , more than 20 , 000 people dangerously and illegally crossed the English channel , 18 % more than did so in the same 150 days in the previous year . I do not call an 18 % year - on - year increase “ delivering results ” ; that is a failure . Why are these figures up year on year ? The National Crime Agency told us that we needed a deterrent but that law enforcement alone would not be enough , yet the Government cancelled the Rwanda deterrent before it had even started . The first flight was due to take off on 24 July , and they cancelled it before it even took off . Of course we welcome the law enforcement that continues the work done by the last Government , but according to the NCA that alone will not be enough , so we need a deterrent . When will the Home Secretary introduce one ? In the spirit of examining the right hon . Lady ’ s claim that she is delivering results , let us look at the Government ’ s record on asylum hotels . In their manifesto , they promised to close down and end the use of asylum hotels . According to figures that we obtained recently , in the three months following the election , far from reducing asylum hotel use they increased it , by 6 , 066 people . In places such as Peterborough and Altrincham , which are now represented by Labour MPs , asylum hotels were opened up in express contradiction of their own manifesto commitment . Let me say a word about removals . It is welcome that overall removals have gone up , continuing the trend under the previous Government , although I observe that almost all those removals were to European and North American countries . The Home Secretary did not break out the numbers on small boat returns , and I wonder why that was .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-12-11.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-12-11.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2024-11-06.txt | debates2024-11-06_F24 | 2024-11-06 | UK", "debates2024-11-06.txt | debates2024-11-06_F25 | 2024-11-06 | UK", "debates2024-12-11.txt | debates2024-12-11_F22 | 2024-12-11 | UK", "debates2025-03-31.txt | debates2025-03-31_F1 | 2025-03-31 | UK", "debates2025-09-01.txt | debates2025-09-01_F22 | 2025-09-01 | UK"], "answer": "The context does not contain this information.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:08:33"}

When does she expect those measures to start producing a reduction in crossings ?", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-11-06.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-11-06.txt"}, {"score": 0.6215367913246155, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-06_F24", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-06.txt", "date": "2024-11-06", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Since they came to office , 17 , 520 people have crossed the English channel , more than twice the number they have removed . That is one and a half times the number in the previous four months and 15 % more than the same period last year . In October alone , last month , 5 , 417 people crossed , three times higher than in last October . Tragically , since this Government came to office 50 people have lost their lives or gone missing — more than in the previous 18 months put together — and , tragically , that includes 16 women and children . This Government decided — they chose — to cancel the Rwanda scheme before it had even started . The first flight was due to take off , from memory , on 24 July but they cancelled it . Had they allowed that to go ahead and the scheme to continue , the deterrent effect would by now have started . We know it works , because it worked in Australia under its Operation Sovereign Borders about 10 years ago . We know the deterrent effect of returns works : it worked with Albania where we secured a 93 % reduction in arrivals . Do not just take my word for it : the National Crime Agency said that law enforcement alone is not enough and we need an effective removal scheme to deter crossings . The Government ’ s announcements in Glasgow on Monday are simply not enough , and they repeat work that is under way already . The NCA and I are not the only ones saying that we need a returns deterrent . Just a few weeks ago , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen encouraged member states to develop their own returns hubs outside the European Union . Will the Minister follow Ursula von der Leyen ’ s advice and urgently implement offshore processing ? May I also draw attention to the success that Belgium has had in stopping boats by the shore ? Will the Minister ask France to do the same ? Finally , because of their failings Labour are breaking their manifesto pledge to end hotel use , so will she pledge not to open any more hotels ? I welcome the right hon . Gentleman — the shadow Home Secretary — to his new Front - Bench position . What a pleasure it is to be opposite him ; I am going to look forward to jousting with him over the years . On the Rwanda scheme , during the period from when it began to when we scrapped it , 83 , 500 people crossed in small boats . If that is a deterrent , the right hon . Gentleman has a peculiar view of the meaning of “ deterrence ” in the English language . When I realised that we were doing this urgent question , I took the opportunity to look at the right hon . Gentleman ’ s record as a Home Office Minister . During his first stint at the Home Office — from September 2019 to 2021 — 23 , 849 people crossed the channel on small boats . During his second ministerial sojourn at the Home Office , 50 , 637 people crossed the channel in small boats , so his overall total is 74 , 486 . In September 2020 , the shadow Home Secretary answered an urgent question . He said that the last Government would “ not rest until we have taken the necessary steps to completely end these crossings . ” — [ Official Report , 2 September 2020 ; Vol . 679 , c . 168 . ] How did that go ? In 2018 , 400 crossed the channel .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-11-06.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-11-06.txt"}, {"score": 0.6199261546134949, "chunk_id": "debates2024-12-11_F22", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-12-11.txt", "date": "2024-12-11", "parliament": "UK", "text": "We certainly support the efforts of this Government and others around the world to secure a transition to a stable Government in Syria that can ensure the return of peace . We also support the suspension of asylum processing ; I am glad that the Government made that decision a few hours after I called for it yesterday . Does the Home Secretary agree that , given that most if not all the asylum claims are predicated on the threat posed to the individual by former President Assad , now that that threat has gone and the basis for the asylum claims has therefore gone , it would be reasonable to ask Syrians who are claiming or have recently been granted asylum on that basis to return once they are safe ? Earlier today , the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister if he would ensure that no former UK residents who are in Syria and who supported the murderous Daesh regime that killed and raped innocent women and children , persecuted minorities and severely persecuted its opponents return to the UK . In government , the Conservatives ensured that those people did not return — the Shamima Begum case was an example — so will the Home Secretary take similarly robust action to ensure that people who supported Daesh do not return to the United Kingdom ? I think the House would appreciate such an assurance . Let me now turn to the question of small boats and border security . The Home Secretary asserted , I must say rather boldly , that her approach was “ delivering results ” , but I am afraid the facts do not bear that out . Let us have a look at the results that are actually being delivered . In the 150 days since the election , more than 20 , 000 people dangerously and illegally crossed the English channel , 18 % more than did so in the same 150 days in the previous year . I do not call an 18 % year - on - year increase “ delivering results ” ; that is a failure . Why are these figures up year on year ? The National Crime Agency told us that we needed a deterrent but that law enforcement alone would not be enough , yet the Government cancelled the Rwanda deterrent before it had even started . The first flight was due to take off on 24 July , and they cancelled it before it even took off . Of course we welcome the law enforcement that continues the work done by the last Government , but according to the NCA that alone will not be enough , so we need a deterrent . When will the Home Secretary introduce one ? In the spirit of examining the right hon . Lady ’ s claim that she is delivering results , let us look at the Government ’ s record on asylum hotels . In their manifesto , they promised to close down and end the use of asylum hotels . According to figures that we obtained recently , in the three months following the election , far from reducing asylum hotel use they increased it , by 6 , 066 people . In places such as Peterborough and Altrincham , which are now represented by Labour MPs , asylum hotels were opened up in express contradiction of their own manifesto commitment . Let me say a word about removals . It is welcome that overall removals have gone up , continuing the trend under the previous Government , although I observe that almost all those removals were to European and North American countries . The Home Secretary did not break out the numbers on small boat returns , and I wonder why that was .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-12-11.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-12-11.txt"}, {"score": 0.6147474050521851, "chunk_id": "debates2025-02-24_F14", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-02-24.txt", "date": "2025-02-24", "parliament": "UK", "text": "This Government have increased funding for policing by up to £1 . 1 billion next year , including £200 million to start redressing the huge cuts in neighbourhood policing that we have seen on our streets in Thames Valley and right across the country , because we need to get police back on the streets . I thank the Minister for her previous answers , and for her commitment to reducing the number of asylum claimants in the UK . As she will know , the UK is spending 27 % of its official development assistance on housing asylum claimants — almost double the OECD average . Our overseas spend was cut by the previous Government . Does she agree that in order to reduce the number of claimants coming to the UK , the Government should increase the spend on building peace and security abroad ? My hon . Friend is right to say that asylum costs make up the bulk of Home Office spend classified as ODA spending and that we are committed to reducing them , including by ending the use of hotels , which will mean that we can return that ODA resource so that it can be used upstream to prevent migratory flows from happening in the first place . I call the shadow Home Secretary . Border security is fundamental , but between the July election and yesterday , 25 , 135 people illegally and dangerously crossed the English channel — a 28 % increase on the same period 12 months earlier . Does the Home Secretary now regret ignoring the National Crime Agency ’ s advice that law enforcement alone is not enough and that a removals deterrent is needed ? I will just point out to the shadow Home Secretary that when the Conservatives were in government , we saw that many people arrive in the space of just over 100 days , because they completely lost control of our borders and let criminal gangs take hold along the channel . Some 84 , 000 people arrived in small boats while the Rwanda policy that he somehow wants to reintroduce managed to send just four volunteers . We have increased returns by over 20 % to 19 , 000 , which is important . I hope he will explain why he voted against counter - terrorism powers to go after smuggler gangs . The Home Secretary talks about the Rwanda scheme . Of course , it never even started , as she well knows . The first flight was due to take off after the election , but she cancelled it . She mentions that returns have gone up . What she fails to mention is that the vast majority of those people did not enter the country by small boat . The number of small boat returns went down after this Government came into office , and it represents only 4 % of people crossing the English channel . Does she really think that letting 96 % of illegal immigrants stay here is going to deter anybody ? I just say to the shadow Home Secretary that the Rwanda scheme ran for two years . It was running for two years — It never started . Exactly ! All they managed to do — Order . Please , let us show a little bit more restraint , and when you ask a question , at least wait for the answer . The scheme ran for two years , and the Conservatives spent £700 million of taxpayers ’ money to return just four people . In the period during which the shadow Home Secretary was in the Government , 128 , 000 people arrived on small boats , and only a tiny percentage of them were ever returned , even though that number included 12 , 000 Albanians .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-02-24.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-02-24.txt"}, {"score": 0.6096218824386597, "chunk_id": "debates2024-05-01_F28", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-05-01.txt", "date": "2024-05-01", "parliament": "UK", "text": "I am very mindful that my right hon . Friend ’ s community in Chelmsford has been incredibly generous . The UK Government have been delivering work in conjunction with communities to provide sanctuary for those fleeing the most dreadful conflicts around the world , including in Ukraine , Afghanistan and Syria , as well as those fleeing the situation in Hong Kong . She is also right to touch on the abuse of routes , which is precisely why we are introducing greater Care Quality Commission oversight and accreditation of the health and social care visa system . I hear my right hon . Friend ’ s representations on accommodation , on which we have had conversations . Reducing inflow is critical to allowing us to get on with closing hotels across the country , and to getting the accommodation picture into a more manageable state . It is clear that only this Government have a credible plan to reduce the inflow of people coming here illegally via small boats across the channel . We will see that through to make sure that we can get on with closing more hotels . As the policy is rolled out , it is seen to be the brutal and inhumane financial fiasco that it is . Asylum seekers were detained as they turned up for their normal monthly reporting yesterday , causing immense distress . A number of them will inevitably be sent to the detention centres in my constituency . We have experience of what happens when people are distressed in this way . We have seen suicides , self - harm and mental breakdowns . Can I have an assurance from the Minister that the charities that support asylum seekers in detention , including Care4Calais , will have direct access to these detained individuals , and that these individuals will have access to legal advice ? There are , of course , established processes whereby people can access the support that is appropriate in the circumstances . I have a principled disagreement with the right hon . Gentleman on this point about detention , and I recognise that those in the Scottish National party do not support detention either for the purposes of removal . However , where people are here who have no right to be here , I think it is appropriate that they are detained for the purposes of removal . That is done entirely properly , in accordance with the law , with the proper safeguards around it . As ever , that will continue to be the case during the ongoing work as part of the Rwanda relocations . I welcome the statement and , in particular , the news that in some categories at least immigration is finally beginning to fall . On asylum specifically , the Irish Foreign Minister and former Taoiseach , Micheál Martin , complained bitterly just a few days ago that large numbers of asylum seekers were moving from Northern Ireland into the Irish Republic . Sky News reported yesterday that the Irish Government are seriously contemplating moving police officers to the border to interdict that flow . In effect , that would create a hard border on the island of Ireland . Some of us were lectured for years , including by today ’ s Opposition spokesman , that the Irish Government would never contemplate that in any circumstances , so the stench of hypocrisy is strong . Will the Minister assure me that we will never allow the Republic to return those people to Northern Ireland unless and until we can remove illegal cross - channel migrants to France ? As for the contemptible remarks of the SNP spokesman , let me say that at least the UK has a Government , which is more than we can say for Scotland this week .

My constituency is a diverse and welcoming place . We have a long and proud history of migrants from around the world coming to work and contribute to our community , and we have a proud history of welcoming refugees fleeing persecution and abuse . That compassion is part of who we are as a country , but our compassion must always come alongside control and a system that is fair . That is why my constituents are right to be angry about illegal crossings . When the last Government lost control of our borders , it risked lives and undermined our national security , and meant that people could cheat the system . It also meant that millions of pounds were being spent unnecessarily while our public services were on their knees . Enough is enough . This Government are determined to secure our borders . Whereas the Conservative party chose the path of sounding tough but failing to deliver , since the election this Government have rolled up their sleeves . Whereas the Conservative party picked fights with France , we have made landmark deals with international partners . Whereas the Conservative party spent nearly £9 million a day on hotels for asylum seekers , we have restarted processing to save the taxpayer £4 billion a year over the next two years , and to end the use of hotels . Whereas the Conservative party spent years pursuing the fiction of the Rwanda scheme to send a sum total of four volunteers , on our watch 32 charter flights have returned migrants across the world , enforced returns are up by 24 % on the year before the election , and our streets have been made safer through the removal of 2 , 500 foreign criminals . The Bill before us does two really important things . First , it removes from the statute book the fallacy of the Rwanda scheme — the so - called deterrent that saw 84 , 000 people cross the channel between the day it was announced and the day it was scrapped . Secondly , the Bill removes a hodgepodge of unenacted and unworkable clauses , whose sole purpose in law is to act as a monument to Conservative failure . Most importantly , this Bill delivers a range of counter - terror - style powers that I believe will enable us systematically to dismantle the vile criminal gangs who facilitate small boat crossings and risk lives . It introduces new offences , so that we can use every tool possible to put gang leaders away ; new powers to seize devices , check biometrics and share data ; and a new role for our new Border Security Command , so that we can ensure that all agencies work together . No more empty rhetoric ; instead , a common - sense , intelligence - led approach to border security . We are taking down the gangs and building the international relationships that we need to regain control . We have turbocharged our asylum system so that we can return people with no right to be here and allow those granted asylum the chance to work and contribute . A real plan . No more empty rhetoric from the Conservatives or Reform ; these are concrete steps to secure our borders , and I will be proud to vote for Second Reading today . I am grateful for the hon .

On one side, critics of current policies argue that they lack compassion and fairness by not adequately addressing the underlying issues such as conflict and persecution in the sending countries, resulting in large numbers of people trying to seek refuge elsewhere. They contend that spending on immigration controls, like hotels for asylum seekers or penalizing France for its border practices, is unnecessary and financially wasteful when public services are already under strain.\n\nOn the other side, supporters argue that robust border control measures are essential for national security and maintaining law and order within their own borders. Critics of this view point out that detaining vulnerable individuals who have no right to be here can cause immense distress, leading to severe mental health issues such as suicide, self-harm, and breakdowns.\n\nMoreover, some argue that border management is a necessary part of comprehensive refugee and asylum policies, which should include measures for processing claims fairly, identifying genuine refugees from those seeking economic benefits, and ultimately facilitating their resettlement in safe locations. They also emphasize the importance of international cooperation to address root causes of migration, like conflict resolution and development assistance.\n\nIn summary, the arguments present a complex debate about how best to balance these competing interests: ensuring strong security measures without infringing on basic human rights, while also addressing genuine humanitarian needs through fair procedures for refugees seeking asylum.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:09:23"}

Does he believe , for example , that Beijing wants to disrupt our democratic process , or instead to gather data about our citizens for some other reason ? On the specific issue of the Electoral Commission and the electoral register , why does he think that the Chinese Government hacked what is a publicly available database ?

I agree wholeheartedly . That is why , as in the debate we had just two days ago , I have always been clear that we need to ensure that the US , the UK , Europe and Ukraine are working together , but we must not choose between the US and Europe ; we never have historically , and we are not going to do so now . I thank the Prime Minister for his comments on that . He will know that it is not just the security situation that worries people ; they are also concerned about trade wars and the economic impact of tariffs such as those levelled on Canada and Mexico yesterday . The best way to avoid America putting tariffs on Britain is to reach agreement on a trade deal . Following the Prime Minister ’ s trip to Washington , have talks on a UK - US trade deal begun ? I was pleased that in the meeting last week we did discuss an economic deal and agreed that our teams would indeed sit down rapidly to talk through a deal . That is what they are doing . As the right hon . Lady rightly says , that is far better than getting drawn into conflict in relation to tariffs . I am glad that the Prime Minister has confirmed that those talks have started . People across our country are worried — worried about national security ; worried about whether we can equip our military fast enough ; and worried about whether we will deploy troops in Ukraine , and whether we will be able to keep the peace . They are also worried about our economic security — can we afford all this ? The world is changing fast and we need an entirely new approach to our economy and our energy security . The Budget last year halted growth with higher taxes and higher borrowing . Yesterday , farmers were protesting in Whitehall again . People are hurting . Will the Prime Minister now change course so we can have the economic security that we know we need for our national security ? We were doing so well . [ Laughter . ] What we inherited was insecurity in our economy . We inherited a £22 billion black hole , and we have now turned that around . We have got the highest investment coming into our economy . We have got wages higher than prices , and interest rates have been cut three times . That is the difference between stability with Labour and instability with the Conservative party . I commend the Prime Minister for the decisive leadership that he has shown in Europe and at home to bolster our collective security . The £13 . 4 billion increase in defence spending has been very much welcomed in my constituency . Will the Prime Minister outline how that increase in defence spending will boost jobs and growth in places such as Stevenage , and will he join me in visiting some of my constituency ’ s businesses ? Our plan for change is built on national security and that has to go hand in hand with economic security . As we return to 2 . 5 % for the first time since the last Labour Government , that investment must mean UK skills , UK jobs and UK apprenticeships .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-03-05.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-03-05.txt"}, {"score": 34.51558311907746, "chunk_id": "debates2025-01-09_F29", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-01-09.txt", "date": "2025-01-09", "parliament": "UK", "text": "My hon . Friend is absolutely right . Our industrial strategy , through which we will invest alongside businesses and industries of the future , and our infrastructure strategy , which sets out how we will get Britain building again , are two examples of the Government playing their part by bringing economic and political stability . By , for example , reforming the planning system , we will unlock billions of pounds of private sector investment in UK plc — something that did not happen under the previous Government . I completely sympathise with the Chief Secretary about the incredible brass neck of the official Opposition . He talks about kick - starting growth , but can he give us any evidence that growth has been kick - started ? Does he not realise that the only way to kick - start growth in the near future is to re - engage with Europe ? The hon . Gentleman will know that this Government ’ s approach to stimulating growth in the economy is about stability , investment and reform — the political and economic stability the Chancellor has brought to this country ; the investment from private sector partners , as well as from the state , where appropriate ; and the reform of policy areas such as the planning system , or the financial services reform that the Chancellor set out in her Mansion House speech . He is also right , of course , that we need to improve our trading relationship with countries around the world , which is why the Chancellor is going to China today , and why we have begun negotiations with our friends in the European Union on how we can improve our relationship on a whole host of issues , including trade , energy , defence and security . Does the Chief Secretary agree that the Conservatives , having added gutter politics to their fantasy economics and unfunded spending commitments , can no longer call themselves the party of decency in public life , and of sound money ? Yes . It is deeply disappointing that the Chancellor is not here to answer questions in the House on such an important topic , so I shall have to ask my question to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury instead . It is quite a simple one . Will he stand by the Chancellor ’ s comment that she will not come back with more tax increases ? I am sorry to disappoint the right hon . Member , but I will answer the question none the less . She asked me whether I stand by the Chancellor ’ s statements , and the answer is yes . I want us to get serious for a minute here . [ Interruption . ] Many of my constituents in North East Derbyshire , who will have just heard the guffawing from the Opposition , have been really struggling with the cost of living crisis . They voted the Government in , and we are committed to restoring the foundations of our economy . Will the Minister assure me that we are doing everything we can to deliver on that promise ? It is absolutely right that the Labour Government are bringing fiscal and economic stability back to this country , because we know that when you play fast and loose with the nation ’ s finances , you play fast and loose with family finances .

They argue that without economic stability, nations are vulnerable to threats such as rising unemployment, insecurity, and social unrest, which can undermine political and military preparedness.\n\nFor instance, in [Doc 2], the Prime Minister highlights how \"security situation\" concerns affect not just defense but also trade relationships and the economy. He suggests that an agreement on a UK-US trade deal would mitigate economic risks and enhance national security. \n\nSimilarly, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in [Doc 3] acknowledges the importance of stable finances for both macroeconomic stability (as evidenced by reducing interest rates) and micro-level impacts (e.g., ensuring affordability for constituents). He mentions that \"play[ing] fast and loose with the nation's finances\" has negative repercussions, such as higher costs of borrowing for the government, which can affect families' financial situations.\n\nIn [Doc 1], although not explicitly discussed in terms of economic stability and national security, the Deputy Prime Minister discusses the need to maintain democratic processes, indicating that economic instability could compromise this. \n\nTherefore, both from an inter-governmental perspective (as seen in the Prime Minister’s statement) and a local-level governance viewpoint (presented by the Chief Secretary), maintaining a stable economy is seen as crucial for upholding national security.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:10:36"}

Friend the Member for Tatton ( Esther McVey ) was in the Cabinet Office about a year ago . When will we get an answer ? My right hon .

The Chancellor was right to go to China . It is an important economic relationship , but there is a security aspect , too . The National Security and Investment Act has an important role to play ; it is there to safeguard critical areas of the economy . We keep it under regular review , and we will approach the relationship keeping both the security and economic interests of the country in mind .

MHCLG will be in close contact with local resilience forums to see what support they need .

As the Paymaster General is aware , there has been a great deal of concern among those people and the organisations that represent them .

Increasing access to PE and sport is not something that will happen if we sit back and wait for it . Inclusion is not just an absence of exclusion , and achieving equity will require an active effort from all to get involved . I again thank my hon . Friend the Member for Stafford for securing this debate . With permission , Madam Deputy Speaker , I would like to make a statement on the United Kingdom ’ s economic relationship with the United States . The UK has a strong and balanced trading relationship with the US worth £315 billion , which supports 2 . 5 million jobs across both our countries . This is second only to the EU , where our trading relationship is worth £791 billion . Yesterday evening the United States announced a 10 % reciprocal tariff on UK exports , and it has today imposed a 25 % global tariff on cars . That follows the application of tariffs of 25 % on US imports of steel , aluminium and derivative products announced on 12 March . No country was able to secure an exemption from those announcements , but the UK did receive the lowest reciprocal tariff rate globally . And although that vindicates the pragmatic approach the Government have taken , we know that while the tariffs are still being levied the job is far from done . We are , of course , disappointed by the increase in tariffs on the UK and on other countries around the world . The impact will be felt among all trading nations . But I would like to update the House on how the UK can navigate these turbulent times , acting in our national interest and for the benefit of all our industries . I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my American counterparts , Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick , US trade representative Jamieson Greer , and special envoy Mark Burnett for their engagement over the past few months . While any imposition of tariffs is deeply regrettable , from the beginning they promised to make themselves available and they have been true to their word . I look forward to our continued engagement over the days ahead . As Members will know , since the new US Administration took office , my colleagues and I have been engaged in intensive discussions on an economic deal between the US and the UK , one that would not just avoid the imposition of significant tariffs but deepen our economic relationship . On everything from defence , economic security , financial services , machinery , tech and regulation , there are clear synergies between the US and UK markets . That is reflected in the fair and balanced trading relationship that already exists between our two countries . I can confirm to the House that those talks are ongoing and will remain so . It is the Government ’ s view that a deal is not just possible but favourable to both countries , and that this course of action serves Britain ’ s interests as an open - facing trading nation . I have been in contact with many businesses , across a broad range of sectors , including those most affected , who have very much welcomed this approach .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-04-03.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-04-03.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2024-03-25.txt | debates2024-03-25_F23 | 2024-03-25 | UK", "debates2025-01-09.txt | debates2025-01-09_F29 | 2025-01-09 | UK", "debates2025-01-23.txt | debates2025-01-23_F16 | 2025-01-23 | UK", "debates2025-03-05.txt | debates2025-03-05_F11 | 2025-03-05 | UK", "debates2025-04-03.txt | debates2025-04-03_F3 | 2025-04-03 | UK"], "answer": "Speakers often frame the relationship between economic stability and national security by emphasizing that they are interconnected and that one cannot be achieved without the other.

It is quite a simple one . Will he stand by the Chancellor ’ s comment that she will not come back with more tax increases ? I am sorry to disappoint the right hon . Member , but I will answer the question none the less . She asked me whether I stand by the Chancellor ’ s statements , and the answer is yes . I want us to get serious for a minute here . [ Interruption . ] Many of my constituents in North East Derbyshire , who will have just heard the guffawing from the Opposition , have been really struggling with the cost of living crisis . They voted the Government in , and we are committed to restoring the foundations of our economy . Will the Minister assure me that we are doing everything we can to deliver on that promise ? It is absolutely right that the Labour Government are bringing fiscal and economic stability back to this country , because we know that when you play fast and loose with the nation ’ s finances , you play fast and loose with family finances . That is what voters in every constituency experienced when the Conservatives were last in government . They will not experience that under this Labour Government . We are looking at higher interest rates , lower growth and a higher cost of borrowing to the Government ; as my hon . and right hon . Friends have said , we are grateful to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury for being so honest with the House .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-01-09.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-01-09.txt"}, {"score": 34.38181448393341, "chunk_id": "debates2025-01-23_F16", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-01-23.txt", "date": "2025-01-23", "parliament": "UK", "text": "I think we agree across the House that school trips are an enriching experience .

What I will say is that we will , of course , always act in the UK ’ s national interest and that we will not go back to freedom of movement . How much longer will it be before we get an answer from the Government on the review of the vaccine damage payment scheme ? It was initiated when my right hon . Friend the Member for Tatton ( Esther McVey ) was in the Cabinet Office about a year ago . When will we get an answer ? My right hon . Friend the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care met with colleagues on this issue . We believe the vaccine programme had great benefits for the UK , but there is a compensation scheme in place for cases where that was not the case . Earlier this month , the Chancellor rightly went to China to put our UK - China relations on a more pragmatic footing . Will my right hon . Friend update the House on what assessment he has made of the National Security and Investment Act 2021 to ensure that it remains fit for purpose in safeguarding the UK ’ s economic and national security as we cultivate new commercial links ? The Chancellor was right to go to China . It is an important economic relationship , but there is a security aspect , too . The National Security and Investment Act has an important role to play ; it is there to safeguard critical areas of the economy . We keep it under regular review , and we will approach the relationship keeping both the security and economic interests of the country in mind . Two weeks ago , my constituency was hit by the worst snow in 15 years , leaving vulnerable and older residents , schools and GP surgeries blocked in by the snow . I commend the Barnsley council team , who were out 24 hours a day , eight days a week solid , but because resources are stretched , their gritters can cover only the council ’ s primary and secondary roads . Does the Minister agree that much more should be done to improve national resilience in extreme and exceptional circumstances where snow is prolonged by cold temperatures , by giving local authorities that cover rural areas such as mine increased gritting resources and access to snow ploughs ? I thank my hon . Friend for the work she did to support constituents during the heavy snowfall , and I thank Barnsley council and other responders for their work . This responsibility lies with local authorities , but I know that my colleagues in the Cabinet Office , the Department for Transport and the Ministry of Housing , Communities and Local Government are keen for authorities to receive as much support as possible . MHCLG will be in close contact with local resilience forums to see what support they need . What progress has been made on improving engagement with those infected and affected by the contaminated blood scandal ? As the Paymaster General is aware , there has been a great deal of concern among those people and the organisations that represent them .

Increasing access to PE and sport is not something that will happen if we sit back and wait for it . Inclusion is not just an absence of exclusion , and achieving equity will require an active effort from all to get involved . I again thank my hon . Friend the Member for Stafford for securing this debate . With permission , Madam Deputy Speaker , I would like to make a statement on the United Kingdom ’ s economic relationship with the United States . The UK has a strong and balanced trading relationship with the US worth £315 billion , which supports 2 . 5 million jobs across both our countries . This is second only to the EU , where our trading relationship is worth £791 billion . Yesterday evening the United States announced a 10 % reciprocal tariff on UK exports , and it has today imposed a 25 % global tariff on cars . That follows the application of tariffs of 25 % on US imports of steel , aluminium and derivative products announced on 12 March . No country was able to secure an exemption from those announcements , but the UK did receive the lowest reciprocal tariff rate globally . And although that vindicates the pragmatic approach the Government have taken , we know that while the tariffs are still being levied the job is far from done . We are , of course , disappointed by the increase in tariffs on the UK and on other countries around the world . The impact will be felt among all trading nations . But I would like to update the House on how the UK can navigate these turbulent times , acting in our national interest and for the benefit of all our industries . I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my American counterparts , Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick , US trade representative Jamieson Greer , and special envoy Mark Burnett for their engagement over the past few months . While any imposition of tariffs is deeply regrettable , from the beginning they promised to make themselves available and they have been true to their word . I look forward to our continued engagement over the days ahead . As Members will know , since the new US Administration took office , my colleagues and I have been engaged in intensive discussions on an economic deal between the US and the UK , one that would not just avoid the imposition of significant tariffs but deepen our economic relationship . On everything from defence , economic security , financial services , machinery , tech and regulation , there are clear synergies between the US and UK markets . That is reflected in the fair and balanced trading relationship that already exists between our two countries . I can confirm to the House that those talks are ongoing and will remain so . It is the Government ’ s view that a deal is not just possible but favourable to both countries , and that this course of action serves Britain ’ s interests as an open - facing trading nation . I have been in contact with many businesses , across a broad range of sectors , including those most affected , who have very much welcomed this approach .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-04-03.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-04-03.txt"}, {"score": 34.058436162571546, "chunk_id": "2025-07-02_F5", "parent_id": null, "filename": "2025-07-02.txt", "date": "2025-07-02", "parliament": "US", "text": "Charles Jameson , for his unwavering commitment to our community . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < / pre > Title : HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF FLAD ; Congressional Record Vol . 171 , No . 114 Section : Extensions of Remarks Section Date : 2025 - 07 - 02 Volume : 171 , Issue : 114 Pages : E641 - E641 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = < pre > [ Extensions of Remarks ] [ Page E641 ] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ < a href = ' https : / / www . gpo . gov ' > www . gpo . gov < / a > ] HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF FLAD _ _ _ _ _ _ HON . JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Wednesday , July 2 , 2025 Mr . COSTA . Mr . Speaker , I rise today to honor the 40th Anniversary of Luso - American Development Foundation ( FLAD ) . The strengthening historic alliance between Portugal and the United States led to the creation of FLAD in 1985 . Its purpose at the time was to strengthen the relationship between our two countries through cultural exchanges and societal transatlantic relationships . In 1983 , the United States and Portugal formed a Cooperation and Defense Agreement . This agreement piloted the establishment of FLAD . This year FLAD also celebrates its ninth edition of the FLAD Legislators Dialogue , which brings together United States lawmakers of Portuguese ancestry with Portuguese leaders in Lisbon to foster powerful discussions on the strongest path forward to build relations and strengthen our collective security . FLAD supports the work of Portuguese and Portuguese American students , researchers , scientists , and teachers at the forefront of science , while also facilitating contacts and collaborations with renowned U . S . institutions to build bridges between our two countries and establish new partnerships and possibilities for all generations . FLAD & # x27 ; s work also supports visiting professors at prestigious U . S . universities , such as Fresno State University , Brown University , Georgetown University , and University of Massachusetts Lowell to teach Portuguese Studies with the hopes of increasing Portuguese speakers in the United States . FLAD has been highly successful in promoting internships for American students and facilitating their participation in programs in Portugal . FLAD has been a principal supporter of Portuguese art and culture by collaborating on numerous initiatives that preserve the presence of Portuguese culture in the United States , allowing exchanges between artists , intellectuals and researchers of the two countries . FLAD & # x27 ; s contemporary art collection includes about 1000 works of art from Portuguese artists . FLAD has continuously partnered with the California Portuguese American Coalition ( CPAC ) in supporting Portuguese advocacy within California communities . These local communities helped shape the American culture and the economic growth throughout California & # x27 ; s Central Valley and nationwide . Mr . Speaker , as proud descendants of Portuguese immigrants , with the traditions and values from the Azores Islands never far from our hearts , I ask that our colleagues join us in celebrating the 40th anniversary of FLAD and recognizing the contributions of FLAD to U . S . - Portugal relations .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\US\\2025-07-02.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/US/2025-07-02.txt"}, {"score": 33.52579534978456, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-06_F14", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-06.txt", "date": "2024-11-06", "parliament": "UK", "text": "] Order . Mr Perkins , I do not need any more . Your voice carries ; it is like mine — too loud . Will the Prime Minister show that he and his Government can be more than student politicians by asking you , Mr Speaker , to extend an invitation to President Trump to address Parliament on his next visit ? The Leader of the Opposition is giving a masterclass on student politics ! But seriously , we live in probably a more volatile world than we have lived in for many decades . It is absolutely crucial that we have a strong relationship — that strong , special relationship , forged in difficult circumstances — between the US and the UK . We will continue to work , as we have done in our four months in government , on issues of security , our economy and global conflict . The Prime Minister does not answer the questions ; he just reads the lines the officials have prepared for him . It does not sound like he wants to invite President - elect Trump to Parliament . He needs to look after the special relationship . The US is our single biggest trade partner . Given the risk of increased tariffs on UK exports , which threatens our manufacturing sector , will the Prime Minister commit now to continuing the negotiations on our free trade agreement with the US , which the Biden Administration cancelled when they came into office ? Of course we will discuss issues of our economy with the President - elect , as we already have done . Economy , security and global conflict are issues of real significance that ought to unite this House . When it comes to the economy , what we have done with our Budget is to fix the foundations after 14 years , and return economic stability after the £22 billion black hole . We have protected the payslips of working people . We have made the single biggest investment in our country for a generation in the NHS , schools and homes . We have given a pay rise to the 3 million lowest paid . If the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to that investment or the pay rise for working people — she is a straight talker , as I understand it — perhaps she should say so . Discuss , discuss , discuss ; chat , chat , chat — the Prime Minister has no plans whatsoever for building on the special relationship . He needs to realise that we in this country rely on our single biggest trade partner . President Trump is also right to argue that Europe needs to increase its defence spending . The last Conservative Government committed to raising defence spending to 2 . 5 % of GDP by 2030 . Will the Prime Minister finally match that commitment ? There is no more important duty than keeping the people of this country safe . It was the Labour Government who signed the NATO treaty in the first place , and we are strong supporters . We have a strategic defence review , and we are committed to 2 . 5 % . [ Interruption . ] I remind Conservative Members that the last time 2 . 5 % was met was under the last Labour Government . Fourteen years , and they never did it once . Last year , the National Audit Office identified a £17 billion black hole in the Ministry of Defence finances . The former Defence Secretary said that the previous Government “ hollowed out ” the armed forces . The plan that the Conservatives put forward at the election was pure fantasy . The Prime Minister will not make that commitment ; that is very clear .

I said in my opening remarks that the investments that we made in the spending review , which did not fall from the sky but came about because of choices made by the Government , contribute to the strength and resilience of the country . That is why the strategy talks of three pillars — homeland security , alliances abroad and deepening our sovereign capabilities — and all three are important . Given the scale of foreign - influence operations , particularly those of China , does the Minister accept that Britain ’ s societal resilience remains far too limited ? Without clear Government messaging , how can institutions or the public properly play their role ? Will the Minister commit to expanding the defending democracy taskforce to include public education , support for free media , and curbing People ’ s Liberation Army - linked speakers at taxpayer funded events ? I would say that my faith in British society was strong . It is a strong society with deeply held democratic values . We never take that for granted , but it has been enduring and strong over the years . The hon . Member is right to draw attention to the importance of defending our democracy .

Economic stability is viewed as essential for providing the necessary foundation to support robust national security efforts. By ensuring economic stability, governments can invest more effectively in defense capabilities, such as strengthening homeland security and alliances abroad.\n\nFor instance:\n\n1. **Economic Stability Ensures Security Resources**: When the economy is stable and prosperous, it's easier for a government to allocate resources towards defense spending without risking the paychecks of working people or weakening vital sectors like healthcare and education that are crucial for long-term national security.\n\n2. **Stable Economy Prevents Vulnerabilities**: An unstable economy can create vulnerabilities within society that adversaries might exploit, reducing overall resilience against threats.\n\n3. **Strong National Security Requires Economic Stability**: Economic stability provides the financial muscle necessary to fund military initiatives, maintain infrastructure, and support defense technology advancements – all of which are critical for national security.\n\n4. **Defense Spending as Part of Investment Strategy**: Speakers frequently emphasize that investments made during economic reviews contribute to the country's overall strength and resilience against threats, highlighting how economic stability supports both domestic and international security efforts.\n\nBy emphasizing these points, speakers aim to justify investment in defense spending and highlight how a strong economy is indispensable for maintaining national security.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:12:09"}

For an ageing population with increasing healthcare needs and diminishing birth rates — that is , the people who are going to pay for the NHS — we need a cross - party discussion that brings all parties together to make long - term decisions on how we proceed with health and social care in this country . If I achieve nothing else in my time here , starting that conversation , and hopefully progressing it fruitfully , will be something to hope for . As a traditional , common - sense Conservative , I believe that we cannot pay for health and social care unless we have a strong economy . Despite a global pandemic , a war in the east of Europe and instability in the middle east , and regardless of the picture that the Government are trying to paint in their press releases , the most recent statistics show that the economy is turning around and is on an upward trajectory . I will oppose any measures by this Government , including the misguided nationalisation of industry and the socialist labour rules , that I believe will hamper or reverse that trend . Equally important is to safeguard ourselves from external threats . The rise of a resurgent Russia , China and North Korea is something that we should all be concerned about . I do not believe that it is hyperbole to say that we are in a pre - war era , and we need to ensure that our borders , skies and infrastructure , both physical and digital , are safe from threats . That is why I absolutely believe that we should move to 2 . 5 % of GDP spent on defence immediately , and increase that to 3 % when practical . In short , we must protect our economy , healthcare and national security to ensure the prosperity and safety of our country , but mindful that maiden speeches are not meant to be controversial , I shall leave it there and return briefly to the subject of my FAB constituency . In 1668 , Samuel Pepys recorded that the people of Liphook were “ good , honest people ” . Given his own morals and motivations , I am not sure whether he meant that as a compliment , but I assure the House that it is as true now as it was then for the residents of Farnham , Bordon , Haslemere , Liphook and our surrounding villages , and I pledge to be a good , honest servant of them in this place . Thank you , Mr Deputy Speaker , and I thank the hon . Member for Farnham and Bordon ( Gregory Stafford ) for describing his constituency so passionately . While we may strongly disagree on the need for growth and new development in this country , we may agree more on the future of our NHS , and I look forward to working together on that ambition . I am a proud Londoner , and like many Londoners I was not actually born here ; I am delighted to share with you that I was born in Manchester and my family comes from Lancashire . In fact , for most of my childhood I was aware of only one football team — the Bolton Wanderers — but for the last 42 years London has been my home , and the chance to represent my home city is truly a special honour . I put on record my thanks to the residents of the Cities of London and Westminster for placing their trust in me as their representative . I start by thanking Nickie Aiken for her service .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-07-22.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-07-22.txt"}, {"score": 0.4737098813056946, "chunk_id": "debates2025-03-26_F27", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-03-26.txt", "date": "2025-03-26", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Let me turn to the impact of increased uncertainty on our economy . To deliver economic stability , we must work closely with the Bank of England , supporting the independent Monetary Policy Committee to meet the 2 % inflation target . There have been three interest rate cuts since the general election , and today ’ s data shows that inflation fell in February , having peaked at 11 % under the previous Government . The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that consumer prices index inflation will average 3 . 2 % this year , before falling rapidly to 2 . 1 % in 2026 and meeting the 2 % target from 2027 onwards , giving families and businesses the security that they need , and providing our economy with the stable platform that it needs to grow . Earlier this month , the OECD downgraded this year ’ s growth forecast for every G7 economy , including the UK , and the OBR has today revised down our growth forecast for 2025 from 2 % in the autumn to 1 % today . I am not satisfied with these numbers . We Labour Members are serious about taking the action needed to grow our economy ; we are backing the builders , not the blockers , with a third runway at Heathrow airport and through the Planning and Infrastructure Bill . We are increasing investment with reforms to our pension system and a new national wealth fund , and tearing down regulatory barriers in every sector of our economy . That is a serious plan for growth . That is a serious plan to improve living standards . That is a serious plan to renew our country . A changing world presents challenges , but also opportunities for new jobs and new contracts in our world - class defence industrial centres from Belfast to Deeside , and from Plymouth to Rosyth . In February , the Prime Minister set out our Government ’ s commitment to increasing spending on defence to 2 . 5 % of GDP from April 2027 — the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war — and an ambition to spend 3 % of GDP on defence in the next Parliament . That was the right decision in a more insecure world — we are putting an extra £6 . 4 billion into defence spending by 2027 — but we have to move quickly in this changing world , and that starts with investment . Today , I can confirm that I will provide an additional £2 . 2 billion for the Ministry of Defence in the next financial year — a further down payment on our plan to deliver 2 . 5 % of GDP by 2027 . This additional investment is about increasing not just our national security , but our economic security . As defence spending rises , I want the whole country to feel its benefits , so I will now set out the immediate steps that we are taking to boost Britain ’ s defence industry , and to make the UK a defence industrial superpower . We will spend a minimum of 10 % of the Ministry of Defence ’ s equipment budget on new , novel technologies , including drones and artificial intelligence - enabled technology , driving forward advanced manufacturing production in places like Glasgow , Derby and Newport , creating demand for highly skilled engineers and scientists , and delivering new business opportunities for UK tech firms and start - ups .

The Government have claimed that it would not be appropriate for him as a special adviser to answer questions from the Committee . However , in this case , it is more than clear that Mr Powell ’ s role as the National Security Adviser puts him in a unique position — a unique senior position — and it appears that , as the lead adviser for the Government ’ s national security strategy , it is only right that the Joint Committee be able to put questions to him .

We believe that both were the wrong approach . Instead , our approach will be marked by a desire to protect our national security and to promote our economic interests ; total disengagement is not a good option for the UK , so we will be guided by both . The Foreign Secretary , as I said , will make a fuller statement on China shortly . The right hon . Lady asks what might be included in the 1 . 5 % .

In particular , what advice is being given to the nations and regions when they are dealing with our third - biggest trading partner , with whom we need to promote but also protect ourselves ? I thank the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee for her question . If people look at page 39 of the document , they will see many references to China , and I referred to the statement that the Foreign Secretary is going to make . On our advice to people , as I said , it is guided by the protection of our security interest and the promotion of our economic interest . She refers specifically to the devolved Governments and the nations and regions . We did arrange a recent security briefing for the First Ministers at the time of the recent meeting of the Council of the Nations and Regions , because we agree it is important to bring them into our thinking and help them play their role in protecting our national security interest , too . The right hon . Gentleman ’ s long experience will tell him that sometimes in government the grander the language the less significant the actual announcement . But if on this occasion — I am perfectly prepared to accept that this is so — the Government are making a serious effort to redraw the boundaries of what is national security policy and what is not , does he agree that we need matching parliamentary scrutiny of that area of policy ? As he knows , the Intelligence and Security Committee is the only Committee with the necessary clearances to look at classified material . Does he think that this is a good moment to look again at the memorandum of understanding between the Committee and the Government about what the Committee covers ? The right hon . and learned Gentleman is right to say that the document is distinguished by a broader view of national security , which is also reflected in the discussion at NATO today , where we are looking beyond our core defence expenditure on our armed forces to the other things we have discussed that contribute to our national security . I thank the Intelligence and Security Committee for its work in all its iterations over the years . I have a good dialogue with the Committee . I look forward to that continuing , and to the Committee playing its very important role . I welcome my right hon . Friend ’ s focus on building up our armed forces in this more uncertain world , but is it not also vital for our national security that we focus on preventing conflict ? Bringing sides together to negotiate and mediate can stop conflict spilling over and allow our armed forces to focus on the serious threats he has identified in the national security strategy . It is for that reason that former military chiefs , heads of the Security Service and Select Committee Chairs last week wrote a letter to the PM calling for investment in peacebuilding and conflict prevention .

Thirdly , we will increase our sovereign and asymmetric capabilities by rebuilding our defence industries , training our people , focusing investment on our competitive strengths , and using our exceptional research and innovation base to build up advantages in new frontier technologies . All this will make us a stronger and more resilient country , but delivering on each commitment will be possible only if all parts of society are pulling in the same direction . Our manufacturing , science and technology industries have to be aligned with national security objectives . Our industrial strategy , published yesterday , will help play to the UK ’ s strengths and deepen our capabilities . The investments we announced in the spending review also deepen our resilience and strength as a country , with a health service strong enough to cope , safe and secure energy supplies , modern housing and transport for our people , all of which contribute to a strong United Kingdom . That is why it is so important that all parts of Government and businesses big and small understand that cyber - security is national security , and that our core systems and the revenues of business are being targeted by our adversaries . It is why we as legislators have to ensure that our own laws — from borders to trade — fit with national security . This will take a whole - system approach that reflects today ’ s reality . National security means strong supply chains , controls on immigration , tackling online harm , energy security , economic security and border security . It transcends foreign and domestic policy , and it all plays a role in how we make Britain a safer , more secure and more sovereign nation . This document provides the blueprint of how this fits together . The strategy brings together everything we are doing across the full spectrum of national security : the commitment to spend that 5 % of our domestic economic output on national security by 2035 , meeting our NATO commitments once again ; the over £1 billion we are investing in a new network of national biosecurity centres ; how we are stepping up in areas such as cyber capability ; our anti - corruption strategy to counter illicit finance ; the expansion of our legal and law enforcement toolkit ; the largest sustained investment in our armed forces since the cold war ; our plan for defence investment to unlock real benefits for working people ; how we will prioritise NATO explicitly in our defence planning ; a vision for not only deepening our alliances with the United States and the European Union , but growing our relationships with other emerging nations ; the money we are investing in our brilliant research and development base over the coming years , such as the £750 million for the supercomputer at the University of Edinburgh ; and our ambition to gain a competitive advantage in cutting - edge technologies and to embed national security in our artificial intelligence agenda .

That was the right decision in a more insecure world — we are putting an extra £6 . 4 billion into defence spending by 2027 — but we have to move quickly in this changing world , and that starts with investment . Today , I can confirm that I will provide an additional £2 . 2 billion for the Ministry of Defence in the next financial year — a further down payment on our plan to deliver 2 . 5 % of GDP by 2027 . This additional investment is about increasing not just our national security , but our economic security . As defence spending rises , I want the whole country to feel its benefits , so I will now set out the immediate steps that we are taking to boost Britain ’ s defence industry , and to make the UK a defence industrial superpower . We will spend a minimum of 10 % of the Ministry of Defence ’ s equipment budget on new , novel technologies , including drones and artificial intelligence - enabled technology , driving forward advanced manufacturing production in places like Glasgow , Derby and Newport , creating demand for highly skilled engineers and scientists , and delivering new business opportunities for UK tech firms and start - ups . We will establish a protected budget of £400 million in the Ministry of Defence — a budget that will rise over time — for UK defence innovation , and a clear mandate to bring innovative technology to the frontline at speed .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-03-26.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-03-26.txt"}, {"score": 0.4669032394886017, "chunk_id": "debates2025-06-24_F24", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-06-24.txt", "date": "2025-06-24", "parliament": "UK", "text": "On increasing sovereign and asymmetric capabilities , can the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster explain what support will be given to private enterprise and what investment will support efforts in this area ?

Does he acknowledge the need to protect our energy infrastructure from such potential malign activity , and if so , what concrete steps have been taken to increase the very resilience of our own infrastructure ? Finally , on the important role of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy and of parliamentary oversight , we understand that the National Security Adviser , Jonathan Powell , has not been made available to the Committee for questioning . The Government have claimed that it would not be appropriate for him as a special adviser to answer questions from the Committee . However , in this case , it is more than clear that Mr Powell ’ s role as the National Security Adviser puts him in a unique position — a unique senior position — and it appears that , as the lead adviser for the Government ’ s national security strategy , it is only right that the Joint Committee be able to put questions to him . Given the important issue here , and Mr Powell ’ s senior role and central position , will the Government finally let him give evidence to the Committee to allow it to undertake its important work ? We will always work to support the defence and security of Britain , and engage constructively with Ministers and challenge them to do everything possible to keep us safe , so I welcome the chance for these questions to be answered today . Let me express my gratitude to the shadow Foreign Secretary for her response , the spirit in which she put her questions and her welcome for at least broad parts of the strategy we have published today . Let me turn to the questions she has asked and try to address them . On the resources to protect people , we made our commitment to increase defence expenditure to 2 . 5 % of GDP . Unlike the Conservative party , we said exactly how we would pay for that , even though it meant a very difficult choice on this side of the House . On the FIRS scheme , the right hon . Lady will be aware that Iran and Russia have been placed on the enhanced tier . She asked about our approach to China . This is a serious question and we must have a serious approach to it . The Conservative party , during its time in government , veered between the naivety of the so - called “ golden era ” to , in effect , no engagement at all . We believe that both were the wrong approach . Instead , our approach will be marked by a desire to protect our national security and to promote our economic interests ; total disengagement is not a good option for the UK , so we will be guided by both . The Foreign Secretary , as I said , will make a fuller statement on China shortly . The right hon . Lady asks what might be included in the 1 . 5 % . It will include such things as cyber - security , border security and telecoms infrastructure . To those who ask what those things have to do with defence , let me be clear : our opponents and our enemies know that they are part of national security , and we should recognise that , too .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-06-24.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-06-24.txt"}, {"score": 0.46471166610717773, "chunk_id": "debates2025-06-24_F27", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-06-24.txt", "date": "2025-06-24", "parliament": "UK", "text": "In the absence of the published China audit , which we have all been looking forward to so much , the national security strategy has been gone through with a fine - toothed comb by many of us . On China , it states : “ Instances of China ’ s espionage , interference in our democracy and the undermining of our economic security have increased in recent years . ” May we have some guidance on how we will address that , because that is not entirely clear ? In particular , what advice is being given to the nations and regions when they are dealing with our third - biggest trading partner , with whom we need to promote but also protect ourselves ? I thank the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee for her question . If people look at page 39 of the document , they will see many references to China , and I referred to the statement that the Foreign Secretary is going to make . On our advice to people , as I said , it is guided by the protection of our security interest and the promotion of our economic interest . She refers specifically to the devolved Governments and the nations and regions . We did arrange a recent security briefing for the First Ministers at the time of the recent meeting of the Council of the Nations and Regions , because we agree it is important to bring them into our thinking and help them play their role in protecting our national security interest , too . The right hon . Gentleman ’ s long experience will tell him that sometimes in government the grander the language the less significant the actual announcement . But if on this occasion — I am perfectly prepared to accept that this is so — the Government are making a serious effort to redraw the boundaries of what is national security policy and what is not , does he agree that we need matching parliamentary scrutiny of that area of policy ? As he knows , the Intelligence and Security Committee is the only Committee with the necessary clearances to look at classified material . Does he think that this is a good moment to look again at the memorandum of understanding between the Committee and the Government about what the Committee covers ? The right hon . and learned Gentleman is right to say that the document is distinguished by a broader view of national security , which is also reflected in the discussion at NATO today , where we are looking beyond our core defence expenditure on our armed forces to the other things we have discussed that contribute to our national security . I thank the Intelligence and Security Committee for its work in all its iterations over the years . I have a good dialogue with the Committee . I look forward to that continuing , and to the Committee playing its very important role . I welcome my right hon . Friend ’ s focus on building up our armed forces in this more uncertain world , but is it not also vital for our national security that we focus on preventing conflict ? Bringing sides together to negotiate and mediate can stop conflict spilling over and allow our armed forces to focus on the serious threats he has identified in the national security strategy . It is for that reason that former military chiefs , heads of the Security Service and Select Committee Chairs last week wrote a letter to the PM calling for investment in peacebuilding and conflict prevention . Will the Minister commit to using all the tools in our kitbag , including peacebuilding and conflict prevention , to keep our citizens safe ?

It also means taking a clear - eyed view of how we engage with major powers such as China in order to protect our national security and promote our economic interests , and my right hon . Friend the Foreign Secretary will make a further statement on the China audit shortly . Thirdly , we will increase our sovereign and asymmetric capabilities by rebuilding our defence industries , training our people , focusing investment on our competitive strengths , and using our exceptional research and innovation base to build up advantages in new frontier technologies . All this will make us a stronger and more resilient country , but delivering on each commitment will be possible only if all parts of society are pulling in the same direction . Our manufacturing , science and technology industries have to be aligned with national security objectives . Our industrial strategy , published yesterday , will help play to the UK ’ s strengths and deepen our capabilities . The investments we announced in the spending review also deepen our resilience and strength as a country , with a health service strong enough to cope , safe and secure energy supplies , modern housing and transport for our people , all of which contribute to a strong United Kingdom . That is why it is so important that all parts of Government and businesses big and small understand that cyber - security is national security , and that our core systems and the revenues of business are being targeted by our adversaries . It is why we as legislators have to ensure that our own laws — from borders to trade — fit with national security . This will take a whole - system approach that reflects today ’ s reality . National security means strong supply chains , controls on immigration , tackling online harm , energy security , economic security and border security . It transcends foreign and domestic policy , and it all plays a role in how we make Britain a safer , more secure and more sovereign nation . This document provides the blueprint of how this fits together . The strategy brings together everything we are doing across the full spectrum of national security : the commitment to spend that 5 % of our domestic economic output on national security by 2035 , meeting our NATO commitments once again ; the over £1 billion we are investing in a new network of national biosecurity centres ; how we are stepping up in areas such as cyber capability ; our anti - corruption strategy to counter illicit finance ; the expansion of our legal and law enforcement toolkit ; the largest sustained investment in our armed forces since the cold war ; our plan for defence investment to unlock real benefits for working people ; how we will prioritise NATO explicitly in our defence planning ; a vision for not only deepening our alliances with the United States and the European Union , but growing our relationships with other emerging nations ; the money we are investing in our brilliant research and development base over the coming years , such as the £750 million for the supercomputer at the University of Edinburgh ; and our ambition to gain a competitive advantage in cutting - edge technologies and to embed national security in our artificial intelligence agenda .

The statement and the strategy refer to the three pillars of security at home , strength abroad , and increasing sovereign and asymmetric capabilities , and I will take each in turn . On security at home , protecting critical national infrastructure must be a key component of any national security strategy . How will that work in practice ? What resources will be provided ? What further steps are being taken to protect people on British soil from transnational repression ? With China placing bounties on the heads of people in our own country and both the NSS and the strategic defence review highlighting the threats posed by China , can the right hon . Gentleman confirm that China will be placed on the enhanced tier of FIRS ? Will the Government drop their support for the China super - embassy spy hub ? On projecting our strength abroad , the right hon . Gentleman mentioned today ’ s NATO summit , and the commitment to increase what he calls national security spending to 5 % of GDP by 2035 , with 3 . 5 % on core defence . But he does not have a plan to get to 3 % , let alone the 3 . 5 % . It is all smoke and mirrors , so when will he deliver a plan to get to 3 % , and why will he not heed our calls to hit 3 % by the end of this Parliament ? That would be a vital stepping stone on the way to the higher defence spending he is seeking . Will the Government give clear information on exactly what spending will be included in the 1 . 5 % target ? Is there any new money , and does this , for example , include the costs of Sizewell , as we heard recently ? As well as increasing spending , we need to develop a tougher edge for a dangerous world . Given the security threats that we continue to face , will Labour ’ s £30 billion Chagos surrender treaty be scrapped ? It undermines our national security , and contrary to the Prime Minister ’ s claim , our loss of sovereignty has been publicly backed by representatives of the regimes in China , Russia and Iran . The costs also hoover up money that we could spend on much - needed defence capabilities at this incredibly dangerous time . On increasing sovereign and asymmetric capabilities , can the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster explain what support will be given to private enterprise and what investment will support efforts in this area ? I also note that the words in the Government ’ s strategy do not quite align with their broader action — for example , the decision to allow the Chinese firm Mingyang to provide wind turbines for large wind farm projects in the UK .

I hope he understands that I cannot go into detail about the state of those negotiations because that would be bad for the workers , bad for our supply chains and bad for the outcome . The hon . Gentleman talked about national security and primary steel . We are conducting a review of primary steel as part of our plan for steel and we will have the results of that soon . We will look at those results and see what we need to do . I should stress that there is defence equipment made in the UK from electric arc furnaces ; there is not much defence work either in British Steel or at Tata in Port Talbot at the moment . People such as Sheffield Forgemasters produce steel from electric arc furnaces . However , the hon . Gentleman is right to talk about the importance of national security and to say that the world has changed and things have moved on , so we need to ensure that we are protecting our country as we need to . As I said in the Chamber in response to the last urgent question on this issue , there is a reason why Putin bombed the blast furnaces in Ukraine pretty much first : it was because a country wants to have that steelmaking capacity . We are alive to those issues , and that is why nothing is off the table . We are doing everything that we can . You ’ re not ! It is a shame that the Conservative Members who were heckling the Minister have forgotten their own Government ’ s failure to tackle the problems of high industrial energy prices . [ Interruption . ] They can heckle again now , but they did nothing in government . Two weeks ago , I was at the Tata steelworks with the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee . We spoke to people locally , who had great concerns that when the blast furnaces there shut — it was too late for this Government to take action to prevent that when they came in — it was some years before the new electric arc furnace technology was ready to be installed and to operate . Will my hon . Friend do everything in her power to ensure that there is not that same gap here ? The problem that has caused in south Wales has reminded people of the damage done by previous eras of deindustrialisation , and they are concerned that we are now repeating the same mistakes . Will she confirm that the Government will do everything in their power to ensure that we do not make those same mistakes of deindustrialisation this time ? We are very much planning not to make the mistakes that my hon . Friend talked about . We do not want the blast furnaces to shut — that remains the Government ’ s view — and we will do everything we can to reach a deal with British Steel to protect workers and secure those jobs and the production of steel in the long term . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . Speculation around British Steel at the Scunthorpe plant is deeply concerning for the workers and business owners alike , who are desperately waiting for the Government to deliver just one piece of good news . Steel is vital to our green economy as it plays a huge role in our ability to extend our railways and to build zero carbon homes .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-04-07.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-04-07.txt"}, {"score": 0.4530670940876007, "chunk_id": "debates2025-06-24_F20", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-06-24.txt", "date": "2025-06-24", "parliament": "UK", "text": "That summit is expected to agree to a new commitment to grow spending on national security to 5 % of GDP by 2035 — to be made up by a projected split of 3 . 5 % on core defence spending , and 1 . 5 % on broader resilience and security spending . This will mark a new resolve among NATO members to make our countries stronger and , as we have always done , the United Kingdom will play our part . NATO ’ s member countries meet at a time when the security situation is more in flux than at any time in a generation — a time when Ukraine is in its fourth year of resisting Russia ’ s invasion ; a time when we in Europe are being asked to do more to secure our own defences ; a time when security involves not just the traditional realms of air , sea and land , but technology , cyber and the strength of our democratic society ; and , as we have seen in recent days , a time of renewed military action in the middle east , with Israel and the United States acting to try to stop Iran developing a nuclear bomb . News of a ceasefire is welcome , but as we have seen , even in recent hours , the situation remains fragile and the focus must now be on a credible plan to stop Iran developing nuclear weapons . It is to the great pride of my party that NATO was founded in the aftermath of the second world war with the strong support of the post - war Labour Government . Ernest Bevin , the Foreign Secretary at the time , said that “ we must face the facts as they are . ” — [ Official Report , 22 January 1948 ; Vol . 446 , c . 386 . ] Today , in this very different age , we too must face the facts as they are . The generation that founded NATO saw it as a powerful expression of collective security and solidarity : alliances abroad , matched by capacity at home . Our national security strategy , published today and made for these very different times , is inspired by those same values and aims . Every Member of this House understands that the first duty of any Government is to keep the country safe . That is and always will be our No . 1 priority , and our national security strategy sets out how we will do that . The world has changed fundamentally and continues to change before our eyes . This is indeed an age of radical uncertainty , and the challenge to leadership in times of such change is to understand , to respond and to explain . The British people understand this . They recognise that we are living in a world that is more confrontational , more turbulent and more unpredictable than most of us have experienced in our lifetimes . When the Prime Minister spoke to the House in February , he promised to produce a national security strategy that would match the scale of the task ahead . The strategy we have published today does that , with a plan that is both clear - eyed and hard - edged about the challenges that we face . It sets out a long - term vision for how we will do three crucial things . First , we will protect security at home by defending our territory , controlling our borders and making the UK a harder target for our enemies — one that is stronger and more resilient to future threats . Secondly , we will promote strength abroad .

Is the Minister satisfied with progress in that key area ? The hon . Gentleman asks a very important question . Of course , training is fundamental to bringing in the next generation to man our capability . I recently had the pleasure of visiting RAF Valley , where I discussed the issue with the RAF . It was able to confirm to me that , for the first time in a long time , there were more students taking up their places rather than in holds . That is a key metric in which we are seeing significant progress , but yes we want to go further . Last March , the Government said that they would have their Ajax scheme ready between October 2028 and September 2029 .

High streets across the country continue to struggle . What is the Minister doing to ensure that small , independent businesses such as R Young Art Gallery are supported ? One reason why the Conservatives lost the confidence of the British business community was that despite repeated promises to reform business rates , they took no steps to do so . We announced plans in the Budget , back in October , to reform business rates and introduce permanently lower rates for retail , hospitality and leisure businesses . The Conservatives were going to end business rates relief for retail , hospitality and leisure ; we have chosen to extend it . We also announced in the Budget that we were looking at what further steps we could take on business rates reform .

I congratulate my hon . Friend on his appointment as the trade envoy to Pakistan . I can think of no one better , and I know he will make a big difference in that role . The Government took the decision to reappoint Professor Sir Steve Smith as our international education champion to ensure that the UK - Pakistan education partnership ’ s work continues as part of the international education strategy , which is now jointly led by the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office , the Department for Education and the Department for Business and Trade . Led by Sir Steve , the UK has worked closely with the Pakistan Higher Education Commission on revising Pakistan ’ s new transnational education policy . That work will continue , and I am sure my hon . Friend will bring great help to it .

I call the Scottish National party spokesperson . When will the Government make a further public determination on Israel ’ s commitment to international humanitarian law , given the man - made famine unfolding in northern Gaza , which is compounded by Israeli moves to obstruct access to aid ? If the UK finds , as the UN Secretary - General , Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International did , that the Israeli Government and the Israel Defence Forces have violated international law , what steps will the UK Government take to prohibit further arms sales to Israel , pending a resolution of the situation ? Given that the Security Council has just called for a ceasefire , what steps will the Government take through the defence sector to accelerate all available aid for civilians in Gaza ? It is a pity to ask all those questions without referencing the 100 - plus hostages who are still being held by Hamas , who brutally slaughtered the population deliberately rather than as a by - product of war . The hon . Gentleman asks a number of questions . I can tell him that on arms exports to Israel , an issue for which I am responsible , it is , to put it in proportion — I think , from the top of my head — just £48 million for the past year . The numbers are actually very small indeed . He will know that his latter question is one for the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office . What recent assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the defence procurement system . What recent assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the defence procurement system .

The National Audit Office has previously highlighted MOD pilot training procurement failures , so is the RAF now meeting its pilot training quotas ? Is the Minister satisfied with progress in that key area ? The hon . Gentleman asks a very important question . Of course , training is fundamental to bringing in the next generation to man our capability . I recently had the pleasure of visiting RAF Valley , where I discussed the issue with the RAF . It was able to confirm to me that , for the first time in a long time , there were more students taking up their places rather than in holds . That is a key metric in which we are seeing significant progress , but yes we want to go further . Last March , the Government said that they would have their Ajax scheme ready between October 2028 and September 2029 . Given that only 25 % of armoured vehicles have been produced , are the Government on target to meet that deadline ? Yes .

High streets across the country continue to struggle . What is the Minister doing to ensure that small , independent businesses such as R Young Art Gallery are supported ? One reason why the Conservatives lost the confidence of the British business community was that despite repeated promises to reform business rates , they took no steps to do so . We announced plans in the Budget , back in October , to reform business rates and introduce permanently lower rates for retail , hospitality and leisure businesses . The Conservatives were going to end business rates relief for retail , hospitality and leisure ; we have chosen to extend it . We also announced in the Budget that we were looking at what further steps we could take on business rates reform .

We have wasted no time : on top of the £63 billion raised at our international investment summit , our new national wealth fund has already leveraged £1 . 6 billion of private sector investment , and we have outlined ambitious plans for planning reform alongside a modern industrial strategy to secure record levels of investment . I am honoured to have been appointed as the UK trade envoy to Pakistan . Given the growing financial pressure on UK universities , with several leading institutions announcing job cuts amid the deepening funding crisis , what steps is the Department taking to foster stronger educational partnerships with Pakistan to help alleviate financial pressures in the sector in the UK , while supporting Pakistan ’ s educational goals ? I congratulate my hon . Friend on his appointment as the trade envoy to Pakistan . I can think of no one better , and I know he will make a big difference in that role . The Government took the decision to reappoint Professor Sir Steve Smith as our international education champion to ensure that the UK - Pakistan education partnership ’ s work continues as part of the international education strategy , which is now jointly led by the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office , the Department for Education and the Department for Business and Trade . Led by Sir Steve , the UK has worked closely with the Pakistan Higher Education Commission on revising Pakistan ’ s new transnational education policy . That work will continue , and I am sure my hon . Friend will bring great help to it . The south - west is home to an incredibly important economy based on defence , food security , space , maritime , and , in Exeter , life sciences and climate tech and research .

The shadow Secretary of State is right to say that we need staff in place to do the job . The additional funding announced by the Chancellor in the Budget is central to the delivery of this plan — I note that he opposes that funding , which is deeply regrettable — but we need to improve productivity as well . That is why the plan sets out steps to free up patient appointments that are unnecessary or of low clinical value , but , crucially , staff time in productivity gains is also important , so as well as making the most of the additional investment , we are making the most of delivering value for taxpayers ’ money — Order . Please help me a little bit . You have had a good run today — don ’ t spoil it . On hospices , while the Secretary of State ’ s pre - Christmas hospice funding announcement was , of course , welcome , the vast bulk of it was in fact non - recurring capital funding , which cannot be used to help them cover the hiked employer national insurance tax on hospices ’ most precious asset : their staff . What steps is he taking to ensure that they receive recurring revenue funding , to enable them to cover the additional costs ? The £100 million capital investment we set out before Christmas is the biggest boost to hospice funding in a generation , and it comes on top of the £26 million that we announced for the children and young people ’ s hospice grant . The right hon . Gentleman cannot welcome the investment and keep opposing the means of raising it . Would he cut services or raise other taxes ? He has got to answer . Pharmacy First is an incredibly popular service that has allowed many residents in Chatham and Aylesford to be referred for illnesses or urgent repeat medicine supplies . Can the Minister indicate whether there warrants a further review and expansion of this offering , to include further access to medicines , including those to treat common dental conditions with bacterial infections , so that patients with these very painful emergency needs can seek immediate over - the - counter appointments ? Can Members please remember that these are topical questions ? We are making a priority of resuming consultations with the sector to stabilise community pharmacy . Pharmacy First has built on existing services to increase the clinical scope . The conditions treated under Pharmacy First vary across the UK , and the NHS will keep this under review . When we think of social care , we often think of those who are older , but at a recent advice surgery I met the mother of a 20 - year - old with complex needs that local services are unable to meet , so the only option that would allow him to engage with his peers is residential care further afield , taking him away from his family . Will the Minister meet with me , my constituent and his mother to discuss how we ensure that those with complex needs are properly supported ? I am sure the hon .

What plans has the Secretary of State to boost the workforce in community diagnostic centres specifically , over and above the plans that he inherited from us , to ensure that his elective recovery plan is deliverable ? The shadow Secretary of State is right to say that we need staff in place to do the job . The additional funding announced by the Chancellor in the Budget is central to the delivery of this plan — I note that he opposes that funding , which is deeply regrettable — but we need to improve productivity as well . That is why the plan sets out steps to free up patient appointments that are unnecessary or of low clinical value , but , crucially , staff time in productivity gains is also important , so as well as making the most of the additional investment , we are making the most of delivering value for taxpayers ’ money — Order . Please help me a little bit . You have had a good run today — don ’ t spoil it . On hospices , while the Secretary of State ’ s pre - Christmas hospice funding announcement was , of course , welcome , the vast bulk of it was in fact non - recurring capital funding , which cannot be used to help them cover the hiked employer national insurance tax on hospices ’ most precious asset : their staff . What steps is he taking to ensure that they receive recurring revenue funding , to enable them to cover the additional costs ? The £100 million capital investment we set out before Christmas is the biggest boost to hospice funding in a generation , and it comes on top of the £26 million that we announced for the children and young people ’ s hospice grant . The right hon . Gentleman cannot welcome the investment and keep opposing the means of raising it . Would he cut services or raise other taxes ? He has got to answer . Pharmacy First is an incredibly popular service that has allowed many residents in Chatham and Aylesford to be referred for illnesses or urgent repeat medicine supplies . Can the Minister indicate whether there warrants a further review and expansion of this offering , to include further access to medicines , including those to treat common dental conditions with bacterial infections , so that patients with these very painful emergency needs can seek immediate over - the - counter appointments ? Can Members please remember that these are topical questions ? We are making a priority of resuming consultations with the sector to stabilise community pharmacy . Pharmacy First has built on existing services to increase the clinical scope . The conditions treated under Pharmacy First vary across the UK , and the NHS will keep this under review . When we think of social care , we often think of those who are older , but at a recent advice surgery I met the mother of a 20 - year - old with complex needs that local services are unable to meet , so the only option that would allow him to engage with his peers is residential care further afield , taking him away from his family . Will the Minister meet with me , my constituent and his mother to discuss how we ensure that those with complex needs are properly supported ? I am sure the hon .

These are themes to which I will return , alongside the unfinished business of land reform — I read today that a highland estate is for sale at £12 million , with carbon capture and the Ponzi scheme of peat restoration attached , and I know that that is unfinished business . Of course , wild weather and radical land politics are not the only things that the Western Isles have to offer the United Kingdom . There are deep connections to the country and to this place itself . The tide of the Thames that rises and falls outside , marked by Mary Branson ’ s “ New Dawn ” high up there in St Stephen ’ s Hall , is the same tide that covers and uncovers “ Sheol an Iolaire ” , a tidal installation that I installed in Stornoway harbour , along with my good friend Malcolm MacLean , to mark a wartime tragedy and the loss of a ship of that name . That same tide that sweeps into the Viking bay of Stornoway also laps Tarbert in Harris , Lochmaddy , North Uist , Lochsboisdale and Castlebay in Barra . That Hebridean archipelago of nine — or is it 10 — islands guards our western approaches . Were they to be transposed on to a map of mainland Britain , they would run from London to Sheffield in length — with better scenery , of course . That is why I am reluctant to enter the traditional rivalry between maiden speakers of declaring their constituency the most beautiful in the country : when they come , they will see that there is no competition . I do not intend to give a Cook ’ s tour of my constituency , but Barra , the jewel of the Hebrides , is where Angus MacNeil , the former MP for Na h - Eileanan an Iar , resides : fior Ghaidheal — a true Gael — and a generously spirited man , whose chairmanship of many Committees in this House was testimony not just to his political acumen , but to his ability to befriend people across the Chamber . That is one characteristic of my predecessor that I hope to emulate . I will not take the House around the whole of the Western Isles , because time is short , but there are some other political monuments that deserve mention . I have no fewer than four former Labour MPs in my constituency on whom to lean for advice : Dame Anne McGuire , the queen of Stirling ; Ian Davidson , the former Chair of the Scottish Affairs Committee , who is still campaigning for Labour ; Calum MacDonald , the former Labour MP for the Western Isles and our community wind farm expert ; and , foremost among them , Brian Wilson , a former Energy Minister , whose counsel I commend to those on the Front Bench , and who has been a guiding light for me since he hired me at the West Highland Free Press as a journalist many years ago .

We will of course consider what other action we can take . We know that the budgetary position that the Government face is incredibly tight , because of the inheritance that we received . However , it is vital that we make fiscally responsible decisions . What recent assessment she has made of the effectiveness of the early release scheme . SDS40 — the standard determinate sentences early release scheme — was an emergency measure that we had to take to avert the complete collapse of the criminal justice system following the shocking inheritance left to us by the previous Government . The emergency measure is not , of course , the solution to the crisis that we inherited . That is why we will build the 14 , 000 prison places that we need , and have launched the independent review of sentencing . What concerns me is not the past but the future and how to protect the public . Will the Secretary of State assure me that the screening process is sufficiently robust to ensure that violent and dangerous criminals are not released into the community ? I gently say to the right hon . Gentleman that the past is relevant in so far as it sets the context for the crisis that we have inherited , which needs resolving . Given that we all but ran out of prison places — numbers had fallen to fewer than 100 in the summer — it is important that we recognise that the prison system is and has been on the point of collapse . That is why we had to take emergency measures . We have made exclusions to the SDS40 scheme that should take account of his concerns . It is of course important that offenders are monitored and supervised effectively when they are not in prison , and that is what we are trying to do now . Tech can play a bigger role there , and I have asked the independent review into sentencing to look into that . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . There are no specific domestic abuse offences in law , so abusers hiding behind convictions such as actual bodily harm are being let out early under the SDS40 early release scheme . That is not right , so I have introduced the Domestic Abuse ( Aggravated Offences ) Bill to create a specific set of domestic abuse aggravated offences — a bit like racially aggravated offences — that could be excluded from early release schemes . Women ’ s Aid is backing my Bill ; will the Secretary of State back it , too ? The hon . Gentleman is right to note that , under current legislation , it is possible to exclude only offences , rather than classes of offender . I am sure that his Bill will gain some interest across the House . If any such changes were to be made , they would be for the future , as they do not help us with the current crisis . I will ensure to discuss the details of his Bill with the Home Secretary . I thank the Secretary of State for that answer — I hope to have the chance to meet her to discuss it in more detail . The Liberal Democrats are deeply concerned about survivors who have been told that , as it stands , their abuser is set to be released early . One such survivor is Elizabeth Hudson , who I met on the set of “ Good Morning Britain ” today when launching this campaign .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-12-10.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-12-10.txt"}, {"score": 25.98121939225075, "chunk_id": "debates2023-11-13_F1", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-11-13.txt", "date": "2023-11-13", "parliament": "UK", "text": "They always say that former smokers have a passionate desire to stop other people smoking , and she certainly demonstrated that .

I also look forward to hearing the Government ’ s proposals on how the Foreign Secretary will be properly accountable to this House .

Over the past decade , AIDP has trained and graduated more than 500 students in disaster preparedness , emergency management , and humanitarian response . These programs have successfully prepared students to work in local , tribal , state , and federal government as well as in Fortune 500 companies and the private sector . AIDP & # x27 ; s curriculum aligns with FEMA & # x27 ; s Next Generation Core Competencies , focusing on four phases of emergency management : mitigation , preparedness , response , and recovery . Through hands on training , students , along with experts in the field , use the frameworks of the Incident Command System and the National incident Management System to experience complex , real - world disaster environments . FIU and AIDP are setting the standard for the next generation of emergency management professionals , and I am proud to recognize their service and leadership today . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < / pre > Title : HONORING ADDYSON PANNELL ON BEING NAMED BEST STEM STUDENT BY CONSTITUTING AMERICA ; Congressional Record Vol . 171 , No . 101 Section : Extensions of Remarks Section Date : 2025 - 06 - 12 Volume : 171 , Issue : 101 Pages : E573 - E573 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = < pre > [ Extensions of Remarks ] [ Page E573 ] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ < a href = ' https : / / www . gpo . gov ' > www . gpo . gov < / a > ] HONORING ADDYSON PANNELL ON BEING NAMED BEST STEM STUDENT BY CONSTITUTING AMERICA _ _ _ _ _ _ HON .

The hon . Gentleman will have seen that I led the Sudan conference , at which I brought third - party countries together to discuss those issues , co - ordinate across them , and ensure that nothing is done to exacerbate the conflict on that continent . As I indicated earlier , I expect to do more as we head towards UNGA , and to gather those third parties so that we get a pause and can get aid in .

In response to the deepening crisis , the Foreign Secretary yesterday announced a further £15 million of aid and medical care for Gaza and the region , taking our total funding to £75 million this year . We are working to get children with the most acute needs out of Gaza and into the UK for specialist NHS treatment . The Foreign Secretary and I continue to urge the Israeli authorities to address the famine and the catastrophic humanitarian situation immediately . More than 20 , 000 Palestinian children have been hospitalised for acute malnutrition this year alone . Amnesty International has condemned Israel ’ s use of starvation as a “ weapon of war ” , and the UN deputy relief chief has called the aid blockade a “ human - made crisis ” . Will the Minister move beyond words of condemnation and commit to concrete action , including stopping all arms exports to Israel , and immediately and unconditionally recognising the statehood of Palestine ? The hon . Lady raises vital questions . The IPC — integrated food security phase classification — report over the recess was truly horrifying : 500 , 000 people in Gaza are facing famine . We continue to take the actions that we discussed in the House yesterday afternoon , in relation to recognition and the suspension of arms that could be used in Gaza . I share many of my constituents ’ despair and anger about the intolerable suffering in Gaza . Last year , I had the privilege of meeting one of my constituents , Becky , to hear about her heartbreaking experience of delivering medical aid in Palestine . Devastatingly , a year on , the situation is much worse , with Gaza now the child amputee capital of the world and thousands more families pushed to starvation . There have been some welcome moves from the Government in recent months , but clearly not enough has yet been done — nothing can be until the suffering has stopped . What further urgent action can we take to finally secure access to the aid that Gaza desperately needs , and end this intolerable suffering ? I thank my hon . Friend and his constituent , Becky . Over the recess , I met doctors who have served in Gaza . Hearing their first - hand accounts of the injuries that children are suffering there was truly horrifying . We continue to press the Israeli Government . They must act urgently to lift restrictions , open up aid flows and enable the UN and international non - governmental organisations to carry out their lifesaving work without obstruction .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-02.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-02.txt"}, {"score": 0.534397304058075, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-21_F22", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-21.txt", "date": "2024-11-21", "parliament": "UK", "text": "They include a number of human rights issues , the sanctioning of Members of this House and , of course , Hong Kong , but here too we need to engage .

Although it was not on the formal agenda of the G20 , the spectre of conflict loomed large over the summit . Conflict is spreading misery , destruction and despair , and causing children to starve and families to flee their homes .

In response to the deepening crisis , the Foreign Secretary yesterday announced a further £15 million of aid and medical care for Gaza and the region , taking our total funding to £75 million this year . We are working to get children with the most acute needs out of Gaza and into the UK for specialist NHS treatment . The Foreign Secretary and I continue to urge the Israeli authorities to address the famine and the catastrophic humanitarian situation immediately . More than 20 , 000 Palestinian children have been hospitalised for acute malnutrition this year alone . Amnesty International has condemned Israel ’ s use of starvation as a “ weapon of war ” , and the UN deputy relief chief has called the aid blockade a “ human - made crisis ” . Will the Minister move beyond words of condemnation and commit to concrete action , including stopping all arms exports to Israel , and immediately and unconditionally recognising the statehood of Palestine ? The hon . Lady raises vital questions . The IPC — integrated food security phase classification — report over the recess was truly horrifying : 500 , 000 people in Gaza are facing famine . We continue to take the actions that we discussed in the House yesterday afternoon , in relation to recognition and the suspension of arms that could be used in Gaza . I share many of my constituents ’ despair and anger about the intolerable suffering in Gaza . Last year , I had the privilege of meeting one of my constituents , Becky , to hear about her heartbreaking experience of delivering medical aid in Palestine . Devastatingly , a year on , the situation is much worse , with Gaza now the child amputee capital of the world and thousands more families pushed to starvation . There have been some welcome moves from the Government in recent months , but clearly not enough has yet been done — nothing can be until the suffering has stopped . What further urgent action can we take to finally secure access to the aid that Gaza desperately needs , and end this intolerable suffering ? I thank my hon . Friend and his constituent , Becky . Over the recess , I met doctors who have served in Gaza . Hearing their first - hand accounts of the injuries that children are suffering there was truly horrifying . We continue to press the Israeli Government . They must act urgently to lift restrictions , open up aid flows and enable the UN and international non - governmental organisations to carry out their lifesaving work without obstruction .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-02.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-02.txt"}, {"score": 0.534397304058075, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-21_F22", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-21.txt", "date": "2024-11-21", "parliament": "UK", "text": "They include a number of human rights issues , the sanctioning of Members of this House and , of course , Hong Kong , but here too we need to engage .

Over 30 million people need aid , 12 million have been displaced , and famine and cholera are spreading . As the UN Security Council penholder , we are leading efforts to secure humanitarian access and the protection of civilians . El Fasher has been under siege for over 500 days , and famine and cholera — all man - made problems — are rife . It has been described as the “ epicentre of child suffering ” . What is the UK doing to protect civilians and ensure that humanitarian aid can reach those who need it ? I am grateful to my hon . Friend for the leadership that she has shown on this issue . I spoke to the UN emergency relief co - ordinator just yesterday and raised this issue . Of course , we are supporting the call of the Office for the Co - ordination of Humanitarian Affairs for a pause in fighting , so that aid can get in and the suffering can be alleviated . I will of course be leading on this issue as we head towards the UN General Assembly in New York . Do the Government actually have an Africa strategy — not just for north Africa , but for sub - Saharan Africa — and does the Foreign Secretary share my concern about the apparent lack of focus on the importance of sub - Saharan Africa to the security of the United States , let alone to our security and that of Africa itself ? I encourage the Foreign Secretary to reach out to the US Secretary of State , and to join European partners in having a joined - up Africa strategy to deal with climate change , famine and terrorism in the Sahel and all across Africa — issues that are impacting on communities there , and on legal migration to this country . Will he work with his American partners ? I am grateful to the right hon . Gentleman for raising Africa . The first thing that we did on coming into office was establish an Africa approach and a widespread consultation across the continent — that is absolutely right . We must be careful that authoritarian powers do not move in where the west exits . I reassure him that I have raised and discussed those issues with Secretary of State Rubio . Given the devastation of the United States Agency for International Development , the temporary cuts in official development assistance and the growing desperate situation in areas of Africa , is the Foreign Secretary willing to meet me and colleagues who have worked in and care about the region , to understand our long - term strategy , particularly against China and Russia , which are moving in to fill that void ? I am grateful for the leadership that my hon . Friend showed on these issues before coming to this place ; she continues to champion them now . On the Africa approach , and changes to development aid across the continent , whether they are made by us or by partners , either I or my colleague who leads on development will be very happy to meet my hon . Friend . The Rapid Support Forces have trapped 260 , 000 civilians in El Fasher , half of whom are children , and many of whom are surviving on animal fodder .

We stand ready to provide further support . The UK remains in close contact with authorities across Libya to help respond to this tragic crisis , and Lord Ahmad , the Minister for the middle east and north Africa , has reiterated the UK ’ s commitment to Libya in a call with the chair of Libya ’ s Presidential Council . UN officials have said that the western and eastern Governments are working together and communicating on this , which will be important , and we stand ready to help the people of Libya in these very challenging times . The horror of the catastrophic floods in Libya is hard to imagine : loved ones swept away within arm ’ s reach , drowning in mud and crushed under rubble . The city of Derna has been utterly devastated and , as the Minister said , estimates now range above 20 , 000 lives lost . The grief and worry of those with no knowledge of their loved ones ’ fate must be simply unbearable . Our thoughts are with them and with all the people of Libya . As the Minister said , assistance has struggled to reach the city , and the scale of urgency of need is immense . Many areas have reportedly received no help , and there is no hope of rescue for anyone left alive trapped under mud and rubble . There is obviously a terrible threat from disease , with authorities lacking enough body bags to cope with the scale of death . In the Minister ’ s estimation , how many people are now lacking shelter , clean water and medical care ? I know the Government are supporting the United Nations central emergency response fund , but is the Minister confident that that will support co - ordinated efforts and reach those who are truly in dire need ? Surely the scale of this disaster is linked to Libya ’ s many years of conflict and chaos , political paralysis , diplomatic failure and neglect . We know that climate heating is making extreme weather , such as Storm Daniel , more intense . We must help to prevent these horrors where we can , build resilience to a changing climate and support Libya on the path to stability and peace . That will take strategic action on diplomacy , security and development , and we must make sure the humanitarian response , which is desperately needed right now , is delivered . As usual , the hon . Lady has made important points , with her characteristic compassion and passion . I reiterate that we share those sentiments and we are working hard to address the situation . Let me update the House by saying that the UN is currently finalising its needs assessment and we hope to see that this afternoon . The Foreign Secretary has already set out that we are ready to provide support , and we have put some initial support on the table . I reiterate to the hon . Lady and the House that we will continue to keep in close contact with the UN and we are reiterating our support to it . We will continue to monitor the situation on the ground and we stand ready to offer further assistance . The point she makes is crucial : this support needs to reach the people affected . Too often , in various countries , there have been blockages in getting support to the frontline . I understand that the two groups in Libya are working together or at least talking , which is encouraging .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-09-14.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-09-14.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["2025-06-12.txt | 2025-06-12_F0 | 2025-06-12 | US", "debates2023-09-14.txt | debates2023-09-14_F18 | 2023-09-14 | UK", "debates2024-11-21.txt | debates2024-11-21_F22 | 2024-11-21 | UK", "debates2025-09-02.txt | debates2025-09-02_F3 | 2025-09-02 | UK", "debates2025-09-02.txt | debates2025-09-02_F4 | 2025-09-02 | UK"], "answer": "The context does not contain this information.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:19:00"}

It could not be more clear : this is a man who wants destruction , not peace . After 1 , 000 days of war — 1 , 000 days of Ukrainian bravery and sacrifice — I am clear that we must double down on our support . We will not be deterred or distracted by reckless threats . We have consistently said that we will do what it takes to support Ukraine and put it in the best possible position going into the winter . The UK ’ s support for Ukraine is always for self - defence , and it is proportionate , co - ordinated and agile . It is a response to Russia ’ s own actions , and it is in accordance with international law . Under article 51 of the UN charter , Ukraine has a clear right of self - defence against Russia ’ s illegal attacks . I say again that Russia could roll back its forces and end this war tomorrow . Until then , we will stand up for what we know is right , for Ukraine ’ s security and for our own security , and we will back Ukraine with what is needed for as long as it is needed . In challenging times , I take the view that British leadership matters more than ever . For the sake of our growth , our security and making our presence felt , giving the British people a voice on the global stage once again and standing up for the national interest , I commend this statement to the House . I call the Leader of the Opposition . With your permission , Mr Speaker , may I take this opportunity to express heartfelt condolences on my behalf and that of my party on the death of Lord Prescott .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-11-21.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-11-21.txt"}, {"score": 0.5314710140228271, "chunk_id": "debates2025-09-02_F3", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-09-02.txt", "date": "2025-09-02", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Sudan is facing its worst humanitarian crisis on record . Over 30 million people need aid , 12 million have been displaced , and famine and cholera are spreading . As the UN Security Council penholder , we are leading efforts to secure humanitarian access and the protection of civilians . El Fasher has been under siege for over 500 days , and famine and cholera — all man - made problems — are rife . It has been described as the “ epicentre of child suffering ” . What is the UK doing to protect civilians and ensure that humanitarian aid can reach those who need it ? I am grateful to my hon . Friend for the leadership that she has shown on this issue . I spoke to the UN emergency relief co - ordinator just yesterday and raised this issue . Of course , we are supporting the call of the Office for the Co - ordination of Humanitarian Affairs for a pause in fighting , so that aid can get in and the suffering can be alleviated . I will of course be leading on this issue as we head towards the UN General Assembly in New York . Do the Government actually have an Africa strategy — not just for north Africa , but for sub - Saharan Africa — and does the Foreign Secretary share my concern about the apparent lack of focus on the importance of sub - Saharan Africa to the security of the United States , let alone to our security and that of Africa itself ? I encourage the Foreign Secretary to reach out to the US Secretary of State , and to join European partners in having a joined - up Africa strategy to deal with climate change , famine and terrorism in the Sahel and all across Africa — issues that are impacting on communities there , and on legal migration to this country . Will he work with his American partners ? I am grateful to the right hon . Gentleman for raising Africa . The first thing that we did on coming into office was establish an Africa approach and a widespread consultation across the continent — that is absolutely right . We must be careful that authoritarian powers do not move in where the west exits . I reassure him that I have raised and discussed those issues with Secretary of State Rubio . Given the devastation of the United States Agency for International Development , the temporary cuts in official development assistance and the growing desperate situation in areas of Africa , is the Foreign Secretary willing to meet me and colleagues who have worked in and care about the region , to understand our long - term strategy , particularly against China and Russia , which are moving in to fill that void ? I am grateful for the leadership that my hon . Friend showed on these issues before coming to this place ; she continues to champion them now . On the Africa approach , and changes to development aid across the continent , whether they are made by us or by partners , either I or my colleague who leads on development will be very happy to meet my hon . Friend . The Rapid Support Forces have trapped 260 , 000 civilians in El Fasher , half of whom are children , and many of whom are surviving on animal fodder . How are the Government working with allies to alleviate the effects on civilians of the terrible war in Sudan ? The hon . Gentleman will have seen that I led the Sudan conference , at which I brought third - party countries together to discuss those issues , co - ordinate across them , and ensure that nothing is done to exacerbate the conflict on that continent .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-02.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-02.txt"}, {"score": 0.5218126773834229, "chunk_id": "debates2023-09-14_F18", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-09-14.txt", "date": "2023-09-14", "parliament": "UK", "text": "We are also working with trusted partners on the ground to identify the most urgent basic needs , including shelter , healthcare and sanitation . We stand ready to provide further support . The UK remains in close contact with authorities across Libya to help respond to this tragic crisis , and Lord Ahmad , the Minister for the middle east and north Africa , has reiterated the UK ’ s commitment to Libya in a call with the chair of Libya ’ s Presidential Council . UN officials have said that the western and eastern Governments are working together and communicating on this , which will be important , and we stand ready to help the people of Libya in these very challenging times . The horror of the catastrophic floods in Libya is hard to imagine : loved ones swept away within arm ’ s reach , drowning in mud and crushed under rubble . The city of Derna has been utterly devastated and , as the Minister said , estimates now range above 20 , 000 lives lost . The grief and worry of those with no knowledge of their loved ones ’ fate must be simply unbearable . Our thoughts are with them and with all the people of Libya . As the Minister said , assistance has struggled to reach the city , and the scale of urgency of need is immense . Many areas have reportedly received no help , and there is no hope of rescue for anyone left alive trapped under mud and rubble . There is obviously a terrible threat from disease , with authorities lacking enough body bags to cope with the scale of death . In the Minister ’ s estimation , how many people are now lacking shelter , clean water and medical care ? I know the Government are supporting the United Nations central emergency response fund , but is the Minister confident that that will support co - ordinated efforts and reach those who are truly in dire need ? Surely the scale of this disaster is linked to Libya ’ s many years of conflict and chaos , political paralysis , diplomatic failure and neglect . We know that climate heating is making extreme weather , such as Storm Daniel , more intense . We must help to prevent these horrors where we can , build resilience to a changing climate and support Libya on the path to stability and peace . That will take strategic action on diplomacy , security and development , and we must make sure the humanitarian response , which is desperately needed right now , is delivered . As usual , the hon . Lady has made important points , with her characteristic compassion and passion . I reiterate that we share those sentiments and we are working hard to address the situation . Let me update the House by saying that the UN is currently finalising its needs assessment and we hope to see that this afternoon . The Foreign Secretary has already set out that we are ready to provide support , and we have put some initial support on the table . I reiterate to the hon . Lady and the House that we will continue to keep in close contact with the UN and we are reiterating our support to it . We will continue to monitor the situation on the ground and we stand ready to offer further assistance . The point she makes is crucial : this support needs to reach the people affected . Too often , in various countries , there have been blockages in getting support to the frontline . I understand that the two groups in Libya are working together or at least talking , which is encouraging .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-09-14.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-09-14.txt"}, {"score": 0.5141580104827881, "chunk_id": "debates2025-02-25_F12", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-02-25.txt", "date": "2025-02-25", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Ending the conflict in Sudan is a personal priority for me . I recently visited the Adré border with the Chadian Foreign Minister to increase international attention on Sudan , and to meet Sudanese civilians who are bearing the brunt of this crisis . I am happy to announce that I will convene Foreign Ministers in London in April , around the second anniversary of the outbreak of the civil war in Sudan , to foster international consensus on a path to ending the conflict . I thank the Foreign Secretary for all that he is doing . As in so many conflicts , the discourse about this brutal Sudanese war is being fuelled by external actors with economic and mineral interests in Sudan , and with interests in wider geopolitical agitation , such as Russia ; Egypt , with its support for the Sudanese Armed Forces ; and the UAE , with its support for the Rapid Support Forces . There is also the wider user of mercenaries . What further steps can the Foreign Secretary take to use our leverage , not least our trading leverage , to ensure that actors are not fuelling this horrendous war and humanitarian crisis ? My hon . Friend will be pleased to hear that I raised these issues in my contribution at the G20 . I had a lengthy discussion with Amina Mohammed of the United Nations , with the Foreign Minister of Angola , and with President Ramaphosa on the situation in Sudan . I am looking forward to convening this conference in London , and working with the French and the African Union . We continue to emphasise , with all international partners , the importance of refraining from actions that prolong the conflict . The Foreign Secretary indicated that he would engage in further discussions , along with the African Union . Given that there are about 9 million displaced people in one of the most significant , if not the most significant , humanitarian catastrophes that the world faces today , will he impress on the African Union and partners the need for urgent action to try to resolve this situation ? The hon . Gentleman is right to ask that question . I went to the Adré crossing not just to spend time with the overwhelming number of women and children who are fleeing the conflict , but to announce £20 million in additional support for refugees and , in particular , for access to reproductive and sexual health services on that border . The situation is grim ; it is horrific , and has been given too little attention , and I intend to ensure that we do all we can to bring it to an end . What steps he is taking to help tackle the humanitarian situation in Gaza . On 28 January we announced a further £17 million for healthcare , food and shelter , and to support vital infrastructure across the Occupied Palestinian Territories . This was an investment in the ceasefire , which must hold . It is utterly heartbreaking to see the desecration of hostages ’ bodies , and to see men , women and children returning to Gaza to try to rebuild their lives among the rubble . I welcome the Government ’ s efforts on humanitarian aid during this fragile ceasefire , which is becoming more fragile as tanks roll into the west bank . What more can we do to ensure that the ceasefire is implemented in full , and to protect human rights and communities in the west bank ? I know that many Members on both sides of the House will share my hon .

More aid workers have been killed in Gaza than in every other conflict globally combined this year . Those who risk their life to save others are heroes . With journalists banned from entering , aid agencies are a vital source of information from the Gaza strip , and their reports are devastating : almost 40 , 000 killed , mothers so malnourished that they cannot produce milk for their babies , rivers of sewage in the streets , a surge in disease among children — with 40 times the normal rate of diarrhoea , and with polio now detected — and looting ; one aid truck driver was killed only yesterday . I announced on my visit new funding for field hospitals run by UK - Med , which has treated more than 60 , 000 Gazans since the conflict began . Humanitarian aid is a moral necessity in the face of such a catastrophe , and it is aid agencies that ensure that UK support reaches civilians on the ground . UNRWA is absolutely central to those efforts ; no other agency can deliver aid on the scale needed . It is already feeding over half of Gaza ’ s population . It will be vital for future reconstruction , and it provides critical services to Palestinian refugees in the region . I was appalled by the allegations that UNRWA staff were involved in the 7 October attacks , but the UN took those allegations seriously . I have spoken to UN Secretary - General Guterres and Commissioner - General Lazzarini . Following Catherine Colonna ’ s independent review , we are reassured that UNRWA is ensuring that it meets the highest standards of neutrality and is strengthening its procedures , including on vetting . UNRWA has acted . Partners such as Japan , the European Union and Norway have also now acted , and this Government will act too . I can confirm to the House that we are overturning the suspension of UNRWA funding . Britain will provide £21 million in new funds , with some directed at supporting the management reforms recommended by the Colonna review . UNRWA supports more than 5 . 5 million Palestinians , and almost 200 of its staff have died in this conflict . I thank the agency for its lifesaving work . As we look for a pathway out of the wider crisis , I am conscious of this conflict ’ s complexities and am determined to listen to all sides . I approach every decision I must take carefully . Our overarching goal is clear : a viable and sovereign Palestinian state , alongside a safe and secure Israel . There is no way out of this crisis without a route to both Palestinians and Israelis enjoying security , justice and opportunity in lands that they can call their own . We are committed to playing a full diplomatic role in a renewed peace process , and to contributing to that process by recognising a Palestinian state at a time determined by us , not anyone else . I know that other aspects of this crisis are of great interest to the House , including the Government ’ s assessment of Israel ’ s compliance with international humanitarian law in Gaza , the investigation by the International Criminal Court , and what further measures might help to deter malign activity by the Iranian regime . Let me reassure the House that I take those issues extremely seriously . Our commitment to international law is clear , and we are following the necessary processes .

The Minister set out the reports of what may have happened at El Fasher ’ s maternity hospital yesterday evening ; 460 people could have been slaughtered in a maternity hospital — patients , their companions and medical staff . This surely must be a turning point in the war , and for the international community ’ s focus on it . The Minister talked about the special representative ’ s contact , but what specific conversations have the Foreign Secretary and Ministers had with their counterparts , particularly in the Quad countries — the United States said it wanted to take a leadership position on these issues — but also in Saudi Arabia , Egypt and the United Arab Emirates on the issue of civilian protection ? Secondly , I was pleased to hear that an emergency session of the Security Council has been called . What will the UK Government press other countries in the UN to commit to at that session ? Thirdly , are the Government confident that the arms control export regime has been robust in this case , given recent reports ? What is the Government ’ s assessment of claims that El Fasher appears to be at the start of a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of Fur , Zaghawa and Berti indigenous communities , through forced displacement and summary execution ? Finally , what are the Government doing to prevent what is happening in El Fasher from also happening in Tawila , to which so many thousands of terrified civilians have fled ? I share my right hon . Friend ’ s outrage and horror at the reports we are receiving . We have made repeated calls for restraint on all sides in this conflict . We have shown leadership as the UN penholder , as one of the largest donors , through our work with partners , including those in the Quad , and through the work of our special representative . I know that she reflects the concerns of many Sudanese living in the United Kingdom , including in my constituency , about what is happening . My right hon . Friend asked some specific questions . We are in regular contact with our partners in the Quad and engage with all the countries regularly at both ministerial and official level . Senior officials , including the special representative , are speaking on an ongoing basis and asking all parties to show restraint and to refrain from activity that prolongs the conflict . My right hon . Friend asked about the situation in Tawila . We want to ensure that people are supported , particularly those who have fled . As I said , we have mobilised £23 million to support the emergency humanitarian response . I am happy to come back to her with further details . My right hon . Friend asked about the position that we will take at the Security Council . It will be very much in line with the position we have taken throughout , which is to call for an immediate end to the violence and to ensure that international humanitarian law is respected and upheld , that sexual violence is brought to an end and that we protect civilians in line with international law .

There's concern about mismanagement or corruption that leads to aid not reaching those in need or is used improperly.\n\n5. **Political Interference**: Some speakers mention how political interference can affect humanitarian operations, whether from conflicting governments or external powers like the United States, which may influence decisions regarding when, where, and how aid should be provided.\n\n6. **Sufficient Humanitarian Law Enforcement**: Concerns are raised about ensuring international humanitarian law is upheld, particularly during conflicts and in areas of crisis response. Issues around accountability for violations also persist.\n\n7. **Partnership with Local Actors**: There's a recurring theme that while external actors like NGOs play an important role, building stronger partnerships with local organizations is crucial to the success of aid initiatives on the ground.\n\nThese themes suggest ongoing challenges in effectively leveraging global resources and mechanisms for crisis response and relief operations.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T18:19:51"}
