As a former republican , he used to think that this country should not even have a King ’ s Speech , but at least that is one U - turn the whole country will welcome . The right hon . and learned Gentleman is prone to changing his position , but in fairness his speech did strike a few consistent notes : higher inflation , more strikes , more immigration and higher borrowing . The Labour party ’ s plan to unnecessarily borrow £28 billion more every year and give in to inflation - busting pay demands from its union paymasters is dangerous , inflationary , and the British people would pay the price in higher interest rates and higher taxes . In truth , Labour will borrow anything — people ’ s money or people ’ s ideas — and it now turns out that his copy - and - paste shadow Chancellor is happy to borrow other people ’ s work , too , but she is not the only Member on the Opposition Benches to get unstuck by a book . Earlier this year , the Leader of the Opposition had to abandon writing his own book and return the deposit . It was supposed to be his vision for Britain , but his publishers discovered what the British people already know : he simply does not have one . While he stands for the same old ideas , we are focused on the long - term decisions that will provide a better and brighter future for everyone . That is what this King ’ s Speech will deliver . That change starts with changing our economy . We have already delivered the largest fall in inflation since the 1980s , a faster recovery from the pandemic than Germany , France and Japan , and tens of billions of pounds of new investment from around the world . We believe that the role of Government is to create the conditions for the private sector to thrive . That is where new growth and new jobs come from . It is why we have given business a £27 billion tax cut on investment , launched 12 freeports around the UK to create jobs and investment , and introduced legislation in this King ’ s Speech so that we can confirm our membership of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans - Pacific partnership , a huge trading pact with the fastest growing region in the world . [ Interruption . ] I hear from those on the Opposition Benches that it will make no difference . We can only do that because of our new freedoms outside the European Union — freedoms that the Leader of the Opposition wants to abandon , instead locking the United Kingdom into a new European deal that would tie us into EU rules and regulations that we would have no say over and opening our borders to 100 , 000 additional EU migrants every single year . As well as failing to secure our borders , the Opposition would also fail to secure our energy supplies . We know that economic growth requires energy security . We have already invested record amounts in renewables such as offshore wind . We backed Sizewell C , the first new nuclear in decades . The King ’ s Speech introduces new legislation for North sea oil and gas , supporting hundreds of thousands of British jobs . We can compare and contrast that with the Opposition ’ s energy policy — Will the Prime Minister give way ? [ Interruption . ] Order . Members have the right to intervene .

We will recognise the bravery of those on the frontline of keeping us safe with a new armed forces commissioner . That is not just a name or a role , but a strong and independent champion for those who have committed to the ultimate service as a way in which we can show our respect . We will also move quickly on the lessons from the infected blood scandal that the House debated in almost the final act of the last Session : a day when we — all of us — undertook a solemn responsibility not just to deliver justice to those people , but to take on the work of prevention , to ensure that those lessons shape the future of public service in our country . Because scandals like infected blood , Windrush , Horizon and Hillsborough are united not just by the scale of the injustice , but by the indignity that the victims and their families have been put through merely for standing up for truth and justice . So it is high time to bring in a duty of candour — the Hillsborough law — because a Government of service must also be a Government of accountability and justice . That is what service means . I thank the Prime Minister for giving way during his excellent speech , outlining the hope and renewal within the King ’ s Speech , which is much needed in constituencies such as mine , Luton North , where over 45 % of children are growing up in relative poverty . What reassurances can he give me and my constituents that he personally takes this issue seriously and that his Government will address it ? Let me reassure my hon . Friend and the whole House that I take child poverty extremely seriously . I am proud of the last Labour Government ’ s record on reducing child poverty ; they clearly had a strategy , and we will have a strategy . I am very pleased to have announced today the taskforce that will lead our strategy to reduce child poverty . No child should grow up in poverty . We will work across the House on that issue . I am grateful to the Prime Minister for giving way on his newly announced taskforce , which Beth Rigby announced on Twitter as we were all in this Chamber . Can the Prime Minister outline how many children will remain in poverty while that taskforce undertakes its work , which ultimately will lead to the same conclusion that we are proposing — to scrap the two - child benefit cap ? I do welcome this , and I know that it is an issue across the whole House — I do not think there is a single Member who does not care about child poverty . The point of the taskforce is to devise a strategy , as we did when we were last in government , to drive those numbers down . It cannot be a single issue , but one that crosses a number of strands , and we will work with people across the House in order to tackle it . What matters is the commitment to drive those numbers down . That is what we did when last in government , and we will do it again . rose — I will make some progress and then give way .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-07-17.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-07-17.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["2024-05-22.txt | 2024-05-22_F2 | 2024-05-22 | US", "debates2023-11-07.txt | debates2023-11-07_F27 | 2023-11-07 | UK", "debates2024-04-17.txt | debates2024-04-17_F12 | 2024-04-17 | UK", "debates2024-07-17.txt | debates2024-07-17_F31 | 2024-07-17 | UK", "debates2025-04-29.txt | debates2025-04-29_F12 | 2025-04-29 | UK"], "answer": "The speech dates are: 2023-11-07, 2024-04-17, 2024-05-22, 2024-07-17, 2025-04-29.

On Monday , Gordon Brown told the people of these isles that “ the forces pulling Britain apart are greater than the forces holding it together ” . Maybe the Prime Minister can find some time this afternoon to agree with just one of his predecessors ? Where I do agree with my predecessor very strongly is that Scotland would be far stronger inside the United Kingdom . Gordon Brown was also correct in stating that Scottish independence is not simply off the agenda . Those remarks were echoed just yesterday by the general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress , who stated that it remained an unresolved issue — [ Laughter . ] Conservative Members may laugh at her , but she went on to say : “ That can be a very dangerous place to end up in when you are not allowing people to express their wishes in a democratic manner . ” Does the Prime Minister welcome the fulsome , wholehearted and warm support of the Labour party in denying the people of Scotland the opportunity to have a say over their own future ? We did have a democratic vote on that topic , but I would suggest to the SNP that , rather than obsessing about independence , and wasting time cracking down on free speech and trying to lock up J . K . Rowling , he should focus on what the people of Scotland care about : schools , hospitals , jobs and our new tax cuts . I abhor a two - tier policing system , and we must ensure that everyone is treated equally under the rule of law . The Labour police and crime commissioner who investigated the beergate scandal handed their police chief constable a new three - year contract while the investigation into the Labour party leader and deputy leader was ongoing . Now , two former MPs are overseeing the force due to investigate the Labour deputy leader . Does the Prime Minister agree that complete transparency throughout this investigation is of the utmost importance ? My hon . Friend makes an important point . A key principle of our country is that there are the same rules for everyone . On this topic , the Labour leader should show some leadership : stop reading the legal advice ; simply publish it and get a grip of the situation . It says a lot about his priorities that , with his famed legal expertise , he is more than happy to help defend Hizb ut - Tahrir but refuses to help his deputy . The recently published Kenova report makes it clear that the IRA was riddled with British agents from top to bottom . Those agents were involved in the abduction , torture and murder of British and Irish citizens . The British Government — successive British Governments — knew all about it and did nothing . The report also calls for an apology from the Government to those victims . Will the Prime Minister take this opportunity to make that apology ? As the hon . Gentleman will know , the report is an interim one .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-17.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-17.txt"}, {"score": 30.0479172700375, "chunk_id": "debates2025-04-29_F12", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-04-29.txt", "date": "2025-04-29", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Just last week , the Prime Minister announced £300 million for Great British Energy to kick - start supply chains here in the UK . Once the Great British Energy Bill finishes its final stages in Parliament , we will come forward with more exciting plans for our domestic clean energy champion . I welcome the £300 million of investment for GB Energy announced last week . I think we all recognise the opportunities of the green energy transition , but what opportunities are there for my Harlow constituents to be part of that publicly owned energy company ? My hon . Friend is absolutely right to point out that , with Great British Energy and our clean power mission , we are trying to create the jobs that will deliver that transition here in the UK , which is something that the Conservatives failed on for many years . We expect that funding , and much more that will come from Great British Energy , to mobilise more than £1 billion in private investment in domestic supply chains , driving forward manufacturing and industry here in the UK and the good jobs that go with it . What assessment has the Minister made of the number of jobs that Great British Energy will create in the People ’ s Republic of China ? I think the right hon . Gentleman gives the game away there . Although the Conservative party did not particularly care where the supply chains were , we in the Labour party are committed to delivering good , well - paid jobs in this country . If he was so concerned about investing in British supply chains , he might have bothered to vote for Great British Energy in the first place . I call the shadow Minister . When GB Energy was first proposed , we were told it would employ 1 , 000 people and create 650 , 000 jobs . Fast - forward to February this year and that number has been revised down to 200 to 300 , with a vague commitment to 1 , 000 at some point in the next 20 years . As the general secretary of the GMB said yesterday , “ they are going to open a shiny new office…on a high street full of charity shops because they are closing ” the city of Aberdeen down . GB Energy is a white elephant . If the GMB can see it , why cannot the Minister ? Surely he agrees that the way to deliver jobs , growth and energy security and to protect communities such as Aberdeen is to lift the ban on licences , replace the energy profits levy as soon as possible and declare the North sea open for business . I am not quite sure which one of the variety of parts in that speech the hon . Gentleman would like me to respond to . As usual , he steamrolls through his question faster than he ran the marathon — I congratulate him on that . He happens to be the only person in Aberdeenshire who is against investment in his community . When Labour Members voted to deliver investment through Great British Energy — not through jobs in the headquarters but through the investment it makes in supply chains and innovation in his city — he voted against it , and he will have to answer to his constituents for that . What steps he is taking to support the nuclear power sector . Nuclear power is a critical part of our clean power ambitions .

On May 15 , 2024 , Taiwan & # x27 ; s National Defense Ministry reported 45 Chinese military aircraft around the island , in just one day . With these growing tensions , the pressure on President Lai to balance security risks with promises of protecting the independence of Taiwan are high . Though the United States does not have official relations with Taiwan , the people of Taiwan have our unwavering support . We remain the island & # x27 ; s most significant arms supplier and international backer , having approved over $ 8 billion in military aid last month in the National Security Supplemental Aid Package to support Taiwan and other key allies in the Indo - Pacific confronting Chinese aggression . President Lai & # x27 ; s priorities for Taiwan align with his predecessor Tsai Ing - wen , with plans to boost defenses , including increasing military budgets , improving its military force structure , and concentrating on economical mobile weapons systems and more vigorous civil defense . Domestic reform is one of his top priorities , including social spending for the improvement of national health insurance and redirecting economic policy from motives for certain industries to developing more service sector jobs and encouraging domestic consumption . Lai has retained the majority of the Tsai team , including her foreign minister , Joseph Wu , who now leads his National Security Council , and former NSC head Wellington Koo , who now is the defense minister . He also recruited several private - sector executives for his cabinet , prominently JW Kuo , chair of Topco . Along with the Lai administration , I look forward to working with Taiwan & # x27 ; s ambassador to the U . S . , Ambassador Alexander Yui . The inauguration of President Lai Ching - te at the presidential office building in central Taipei featured an overwhelming amount of support for him , as crowds , including a show of marching bands and performers , gathered in a nearby plaza to show their support and listen to his inauguration speech . A bipartisan delegation of former senior U . S . officials , including former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , also attended the inauguration . Sadly , we are in a war we did not choose , between dictators with Rule of Gun invading democracies with Rule of Law . We must stand firm to protect the borders of Taiwan , Ukraine , Israel , and the United States .

As a former republican , he used to think that this country should not even have a King ’ s Speech , but at least that is one U - turn the whole country will welcome . The right hon . and learned Gentleman is prone to changing his position , but in fairness his speech did strike a few consistent notes : higher inflation , more strikes , more immigration and higher borrowing . The Labour party ’ s plan to unnecessarily borrow £28 billion more every year and give in to inflation - busting pay demands from its union paymasters is dangerous , inflationary , and the British people would pay the price in higher interest rates and higher taxes . In truth , Labour will borrow anything — people ’ s money or people ’ s ideas — and it now turns out that his copy - and - paste shadow Chancellor is happy to borrow other people ’ s work , too , but she is not the only Member on the Opposition Benches to get unstuck by a book . Earlier this year , the Leader of the Opposition had to abandon writing his own book and return the deposit . It was supposed to be his vision for Britain , but his publishers discovered what the British people already know : he simply does not have one . While he stands for the same old ideas , we are focused on the long - term decisions that will provide a better and brighter future for everyone . That is what this King ’ s Speech will deliver . That change starts with changing our economy . We have already delivered the largest fall in inflation since the 1980s , a faster recovery from the pandemic than Germany , France and Japan , and tens of billions of pounds of new investment from around the world . We believe that the role of Government is to create the conditions for the private sector to thrive . That is where new growth and new jobs come from . It is why we have given business a £27 billion tax cut on investment , launched 12 freeports around the UK to create jobs and investment , and introduced legislation in this King ’ s Speech so that we can confirm our membership of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans - Pacific partnership , a huge trading pact with the fastest growing region in the world . [ Interruption . ] I hear from those on the Opposition Benches that it will make no difference . We can only do that because of our new freedoms outside the European Union — freedoms that the Leader of the Opposition wants to abandon , instead locking the United Kingdom into a new European deal that would tie us into EU rules and regulations that we would have no say over and opening our borders to 100 , 000 additional EU migrants every single year . As well as failing to secure our borders , the Opposition would also fail to secure our energy supplies . We know that economic growth requires energy security . We have already invested record amounts in renewables such as offshore wind . We backed Sizewell C , the first new nuclear in decades . The King ’ s Speech introduces new legislation for North sea oil and gas , supporting hundreds of thousands of British jobs . We can compare and contrast that with the Opposition ’ s energy policy — Will the Prime Minister give way ? [ Interruption . ] Order . Members have the right to intervene .

We will recognise the bravery of those on the frontline of keeping us safe with a new armed forces commissioner . That is not just a name or a role , but a strong and independent champion for those who have committed to the ultimate service as a way in which we can show our respect . We will also move quickly on the lessons from the infected blood scandal that the House debated in almost the final act of the last Session : a day when we — all of us — undertook a solemn responsibility not just to deliver justice to those people , but to take on the work of prevention , to ensure that those lessons shape the future of public service in our country . Because scandals like infected blood , Windrush , Horizon and Hillsborough are united not just by the scale of the injustice , but by the indignity that the victims and their families have been put through merely for standing up for truth and justice . So it is high time to bring in a duty of candour — the Hillsborough law — because a Government of service must also be a Government of accountability and justice . That is what service means . I thank the Prime Minister for giving way during his excellent speech , outlining the hope and renewal within the King ’ s Speech , which is much needed in constituencies such as mine , Luton North , where over 45 % of children are growing up in relative poverty . What reassurances can he give me and my constituents that he personally takes this issue seriously and that his Government will address it ? Let me reassure my hon . Friend and the whole House that I take child poverty extremely seriously . I am proud of the last Labour Government ’ s record on reducing child poverty ; they clearly had a strategy , and we will have a strategy . I am very pleased to have announced today the taskforce that will lead our strategy to reduce child poverty . No child should grow up in poverty . We will work across the House on that issue . I am grateful to the Prime Minister for giving way on his newly announced taskforce , which Beth Rigby announced on Twitter as we were all in this Chamber . Can the Prime Minister outline how many children will remain in poverty while that taskforce undertakes its work , which ultimately will lead to the same conclusion that we are proposing — to scrap the two - child benefit cap ? I do welcome this , and I know that it is an issue across the whole House — I do not think there is a single Member who does not care about child poverty . The point of the taskforce is to devise a strategy , as we did when we were last in government , to drive those numbers down . It cannot be a single issue , but one that crosses a number of strands , and we will work with people across the House in order to tackle it . What matters is the commitment to drive those numbers down . That is what we did when last in government , and we will do it again . rose — I will make some progress and then give way .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-07-17.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-07-17.txt"}, {"score": 29.29436302718758, "chunk_id": "debates2023-07-19_F16", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-07-19.txt", "date": "2023-07-19", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Does the Prime Minister not agree that there is now no real difference between the two main UK parties ?

Gentleman for his question , and I will leave him and the Labour party to debate the finer points of policy between them . On the substance , because it is important , the track record demonstrates that we are making a difference and reducing child poverty . There are now 400 , 000 fewer children in poverty than there were in 2010 , as a result of the actions of this Government — notably , by moving their parents into work , because that has the single best benefit for those children . That is the right policy and it is one that we will continue to deliver . Conversion therapy is quackery packaged up by bigots seeking to promote their hate and to profit from it . On 19 January , a Minister promised at the Dispatch Box to bring forward a ban against conversion therapy and ensure that pre - legislative scrutiny was completed before the end of this parliamentary term .

We are so grateful for their service and we seek this ban also in their name . I thank my hon . Friend for her question .

Does the Prime Minister remember seven years ago , when he was a passionate supporter of leaving the European Union , along with his then best friend , Boris Johnson ?

I would say gently to the hon . Gentleman that he made the central point at the beginning of his question : it was seven years ago , and we need to move forward . He talked about what has happened since then . Since we left the single market , this economy has grown faster than Germany , France and Italy . He also talked about our standing on the world stage . He obviously was not here for the statement on the NATO summit last week , but nobody can be in any doubt that the United Kingdom is highly respected on the world stage . Just last week the Leader of the Opposition announced his new flagship policy — the two - child benefit cap . It is very popular on this side of the House , but it is not so popular on the other side .

Taxpayers are paying £8 million a day on hotel bills , and 615 people arrived by small boat last Sunday alone . Plan A has failed . After this session , whether he likes it or not , he will have to go back to his office , back to the drawing board and start from scratch . Can he assure the British public that he will drop what his former Home Secretary calls his “ magical thinking ” and start treating small boat crossings with the seriousness they deserve ? The right hon . and learned Gentleman talks about a changed Labour party — perhaps we will see that this evening . He cannot even make his party do the right thing when it comes to standing by Israel in the vote later today . He talks about taking small boat crossings seriously . He has opposed every single measure that we have taken . Let me update him on what we have done this year . The number of illegal Albanian arrivals is down by 90 % . Some 20 , 000 people have been returned this year . The number of crossings is down by a third . He mentioned hotels . We are closing 50 of them , with money being saved for taxpayers . All those measures , by the way , were opposed by the Opposition . What is his plan ? Ah , yes , there we have it : a cosy deal with the European Union that would see the UK accept 100 , 000 illegal migrants . He does not want to stop the boats ; he wants to welcome more of them . It is very straightforward : the Prime Minister promised that he would stop the boats this year . Today is 15 November . He has wasted all his time on a gimmick , and now he is absolutely nowhere . Will he level with the British public and finally admit that he has failed to deliver on his promise ? This Government have done more to tackle illegal migration than any in the past . Let us review : the right hon . and learned Gentleman has been on the wrong side of this issue his entire career . This is a man who described all immigration law as racist . He said it was a mistake to control immigration , and he has never once in this place voted for stricter asylum rules . It is clear that while he might want to listen to the open - border activists , I am siding with the British people . If the Prime Minister was confident about his promise , he would have given an answer saying that he stands by it and will deliver it by the end of the year . The absence of that answer is absolutely amazing in the circumstances . He has had three reshuffles , a forgotten conference speech , an empty King ’ s Speech — he even found time to fanboy Elon Musk — but not one of them has made the slightest difference to the lives of working people .

Perhaps the most ludicrous part of the Prime Minister ’ s speech on Monday was when he said that he would not accept the idea that any of the problems people were facing had been caused by 14 years of Conservative Government . He will not say how many prisoners the Government have released early ; he will not say whether they are burglars , abusers or stalkers ; he will not say where they are or what support their victims are getting . Yet he thinks he has the right to tell people that they cannot blame his Government for any of it . Does he not think that , rather than confiscating lanyards like some jumped - up milk monitor , he should stop issuing “ Get out of jail free ” cards to prisoners who are considered to be a risk to children ? Another week with no ideas and absolutely no plans for the country ! The Opposition have had 14 years to think about nothing but the future , but all they can do is talk about the past . I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition did not bring up what has happened in the week since we last met . Statistics have confirmed that we have had the joint fastest growth rate in the G7 this year . The Bank of England has said that the economy has “ turned a corner ” , EY has said that our growth is “ impressive ” , and the chief economist at the independent Office for National Statistics has said that “ the economy is going gangbusters . ” The shadow Chancellor may want to copy and paste their comments into her next speech — or does she think that they are all “ gaslighting ” the British public too ?

House of Representatives to make blatantly political attacks on American citizens who disagree with his policies . He also made a full endorsement of former President Trump . One wonders if the Prime Minister & # x27 ; s attacks were an attempt to salvage his own political survival in Israel by making it appear that he has the full support of the American people , which he does not .

In addition , yesterday The Sunday Times reported that Defence Equipment and Support in Abbey Wood has effectively been instructed to avoid any new procurement at all for the rest of this financial year . Spending 2 . 5 % is not an end in itself . The key reason that in April we set out a fully funded multi - year pathway to 2 . 5 % was to enable the Ministry of Defence to procure , at pace and at scale , the munitions that we need to urgently replenish our stocks to warfighting levels .

Does he agree that the first thing that must be looked at is the spending of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to lease back the defence base on Diego Garcia , which we currently own ? Why is he still pursuing that deal ? Earlier today , I made a speech about the realism that should drive our foreign policy . As part of that , he must scrap his disastrous plan to surrender the Chagos islands and have British taxpayers pay for the privilege . The key difference between we Conservatives and the Labour party is that we know that we need a strong economy for defence . We need a serious plan to get the British economy growing again . We do not have that with the latest Budget from the Chancellor . Will the Prime Minister tell us whether there will be a fiscal event this spring , even though his Government are committed to only one fiscal event per year ? In summary , the Prime Minister made four points . I agree with him that NATO is a bedrock of our security , as I said this morning , and that the US is our most important bilateral relationship , but friends tell each other when they disagree . We agree on this issue ; we know that Ukraine must be supported , and I share his concern about statements that have been made about President Zelensky . I agree with him about protecting security in Europe , and I welcome his continued strengthening of alliances , but we must do that through NATO , building on the joint expeditionary force approach . Of course , we agree that we need peace , with Ukraine agreed . I do not necessarily agree with the Prime Minister ’ s change of the national security posture , because we have different views on that — I am a Conservative realist , not a progressive internationalist — but I want him to know that when he does the right thing , we will work with him in the national interest . May I first thank the Leader of the Opposition for her support in relation to today ’ s announcement and on Ukraine ? That is important to the Government , to the House and , most of all , to the Ukrainians and President Zelensky . They want to see unity in our House — they value unity in our House — as they enter , after three years of conflict , a very difficult stage in the war with Russia and against Russian aggression . I hope and believe that we can maintain that unity in relation to Ukraine , as we have done for three years . I am very proud that this House has done that , notwithstanding a change of Government , for three long years — we will continue to do so . The Leader of the Oppositions asks about the money for defence , security and intelligence . There was new money in the Budget in relation to that , but what I am doing here is in addition to the 2 . 5 % , which is the increased defence spend as it has always been understood , to recognise that the nature of the threats to our county are different now , and that the security and intelligence services play a key part for us and our allies in our defence . That takes the total to 2 . 6 % .

We have a war in Europe . We have an increasingly belligerent Russia . I chair the defence committee of the 1922 committee . Conservative Back Benchers are very much behind the idea that we need to increase defence spending . What does the Minister think it will take to increase defence spending ? First of all , we have increased defence spending . Crucially , the last spending review saw the largest allocation of spending to defence since the cold war . Yes , we have set an aspiration of 2 . 5 % , and the answer to when that will happen is : when economic conditions allow . It would be imprudent to commit to such a level of spending if we did not think it could be sustained . The worst thing would be to have that spending for maybe one or two years , and then have to go backwards because we did not think it was sustainable . This is about balancing affordability against commitment , but we need to be absolutely clear that at over £50 billion , this is the most we have ever spent on defence . There is an extraordinary effort in support of Ukraine , and we have highly capable armed forces who are making an extraordinary contribution to NATO , including through the latest NATO exercise , and will continue to do so . I do not want to make too much play of your earlier remarks , Madam Deputy Speaker , but I was born on the night the House was bombed and this Chamber was burned out . As I have listened to the Minister , I have been saying to myself — I hope that he will recall this — that he represents the party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher , but now that the world is more dangerous than I can recall it being in all my years , we are not able to defend the country adequately . I say to Members on both sides of the House that this is a wake - up call ; we must act now .

The first is that the right hon . Gentleman said that we had not spent that percentage since Labour were in power . Well , something extraordinary happened at the end of their time in power : they crashed the economy , we had a full - on banking crisis and a letter was left for our Government saying “ there is no money . ” It is no surprise that we had to take difficult decisions , but despite that we have shown our commitment to the armed forces . When he was Chancellor of the Exchequer , the Prime Minister approved the largest ever increase in defence spending since the cold war , and there has been further money since then in the Budget . Of course , we are committed to 2 . 5 % when the circumstances allow . For all the right hon . Gentleman ’ s bluster , he has not even committed to matching our current spending on defence , let alone 2 . 5 % ; we challenged him on that at Defence orals and he was not able to give any commitment whatever to spending . The public know where we stand : 2 . 3 % in the year ahead and 2 . 5 % when the economics allow . We do not have a clue where Labour stands . I agree with the Minister that we have extraordinarily capable armed forces whose productivity is second to none . However , as is set out in “ Ready for War ? ” , our Defence Committee report , they are extremely engaged globally and have a great deal to do , much of which is invaluable . At the same time , they are having to prepare for the “ pre - war ” phase to which the Defence Secretary referred . In that context , does my hon . Friend agree that the timing of the 2 . 5 % target — that is very welcome and a very good first step — needs to be determined by the level of threat as a priority expenditure , rather than as economic conditions allow ? I do not think that we can commit to levels of public expenditure or tax cuts , for example , without being confident that the economy can support them in a prudent fashion — an entirely reasonable and rational approach . However , I totally agree with my right hon . Friend the Chair of the Defence Committee . We all recognise that we are living in a more dangerous world — the Secretary of State has alluded to the threats we face not just in Ukraine but in respect of other adversaries around the world — and I totally understand why there is the wider debate on what we spend , but we already have a significant budget , and we must ensure that it is spent well and delivers value for money . That is why a key priority for me is reform of our procurement system so that we can ensure that our armed forces can prioritise effectively . Ultimately , it is the capability that we have now that will determine our ability to warfight . I call the SNP spokesman . I congratulate the shadow Defence Secretary on securing the urgent question and join him and the Minister in remembering those on HMS Richmond . On Friday , the Public Accounts Committee ’ s found that the “ MoD is increasingly reliant on the UK ’ s allies to protect our national interests . NATO membership deters hostility , but the report warns such deterrence can only be effective if our Armed Forces are credible .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-11.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-11.txt"}, {"score": 0.6190776824951172, "chunk_id": "debates2024-03-11_F34", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-03-11.txt", "date": "2024-03-11", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Will the Minister increase our defence budget , so that we can ensure that our actions speak louder than words , and so that promises are kept , and our armed forces can keep us safe ?", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-11.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-11.txt"}, {"score": 0.6153918504714966, "chunk_id": "debates2025-02-25_F24", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-02-25.txt", "date": "2025-02-25", "parliament": "UK", "text": "In his statement , the Prime Minister also told us about his new value - for - money defence reform and efficiency plan . Does he agree that the first thing that must be looked at is the spending of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to lease back the defence base on Diego Garcia , which we currently own ? Why is he still pursuing that deal ? Earlier today , I made a speech about the realism that should drive our foreign policy . As part of that , he must scrap his disastrous plan to surrender the Chagos islands and have British taxpayers pay for the privilege . The key difference between we Conservatives and the Labour party is that we know that we need a strong economy for defence . We need a serious plan to get the British economy growing again . We do not have that with the latest Budget from the Chancellor . Will the Prime Minister tell us whether there will be a fiscal event this spring , even though his Government are committed to only one fiscal event per year ? In summary , the Prime Minister made four points . I agree with him that NATO is a bedrock of our security , as I said this morning , and that the US is our most important bilateral relationship , but friends tell each other when they disagree . We agree on this issue ; we know that Ukraine must be supported , and I share his concern about statements that have been made about President Zelensky . I agree with him about protecting security in Europe , and I welcome his continued strengthening of alliances , but we must do that through NATO , building on the joint expeditionary force approach . Of course , we agree that we need peace , with Ukraine agreed . I do not necessarily agree with the Prime Minister ’ s change of the national security posture , because we have different views on that — I am a Conservative realist , not a progressive internationalist — but I want him to know that when he does the right thing , we will work with him in the national interest . May I first thank the Leader of the Opposition for her support in relation to today ’ s announcement and on Ukraine ? That is important to the Government , to the House and , most of all , to the Ukrainians and President Zelensky . They want to see unity in our House — they value unity in our House — as they enter , after three years of conflict , a very difficult stage in the war with Russia and against Russian aggression . I hope and believe that we can maintain that unity in relation to Ukraine , as we have done for three years . I am very proud that this House has done that , notwithstanding a change of Government , for three long years — we will continue to do so . The Leader of the Oppositions asks about the money for defence , security and intelligence . There was new money in the Budget in relation to that , but what I am doing here is in addition to the 2 . 5 % , which is the increased defence spend as it has always been understood , to recognise that the nature of the threats to our county are different now , and that the security and intelligence services play a key part for us and our allies in our defence . That takes the total to 2 . 6 % . The Leader of the Opposition asks whether we will tax or borrow to pay for the 2 . 5 % .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-02-25.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-02-25.txt"}, {"score": 0.6152794361114502, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-26_F15", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-26.txt", "date": "2024-11-26", "parliament": "UK", "text": "That is why we are working so closely with NATO and EU partners on that very issue .

The Prime Minister and I met President - elect Trump in September for dinner , which was a good opportunity to get to know each other . We of course continue to work with the current Administration . I was with Tony Blinken just yesterday . Defence spending is a key aspect of our relationship with the United States . Will the Foreign Secretary be able to tell our American allies the date on which we will increase defence spending to 2 . 5 % ? If he cannot , what influence will we have on European allies to increase their defence spending ? The hon . Gentleman is right to raise the issue of defence spending . It has been raised by US Presidents since Eisenhower . He is right that when Donald Trump came to power there were just four European countries spending above 2 % . When Labour left government it was at 2 . 5 % . We are sad that it dropped and we are determined to get it back to 2 . 5 % of GDP . If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities . In the past month , growth was at the heart of my visit to Africa . We agreed work on a new global plan in South Africa and a new strategic partnership with Nigeria . During our UN Security Council presidency we have shown support for Ukraine 1 , 000 days into the war and pressed for a lasting peace in the middle east , and I condemned Russia ’ s shameful veto of a resolution on Sudan . Finally , throughout COP we have been restoring British leadership on climate . Since coming into office , the Government have suspended arms export licences to Israel ; rolled over on the International Criminal Court , with nothing new against Hamas terrorists ; and poured cash into the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , despite concerns over a significant number of its staff double - hatting with Hamas . Many of those things have been published in Arabic on the UK Government ’ s website . Who decides what should be published in Arabic ? Why are they being published in Arabic ? As they relate to Israel , why is nothing being published in Hebrew ? The art of diplomacy is speaking to foreign leaders and foreign nations as best we can in the UK ’ s national interest . That does sometimes involve foreign languages , which is why , for example , we support the BBC World Service . It was a slightly bizarre question . We can all agree that ending human trafficking across the English channel requires an approach that is co - ordinated with that of all the countries from which people are being trafficked . Can the Foreign Secretary assure the House that the French Government share our commitment to smashing the gangs and ending these crossings ? My hon . Friend will be pleased to hear that I met the French Foreign Minister in London just last week , when we discussed these issues and agreed to co - ordinate better , and that the Home Secretary is working closely with the new French Interior Minister .

It would re - establish our leadership in Europe . ” But there is a growing gap between the Defence Secretary ’ s rhetoric and the reality for our armed forces , who are charged with preparing for this new dangerous era . In the Budget there was no new money for defence , nothing new for Ukraine , and nothing for Gaza or the UK ’ s operations in the middle east . Worse , both the Treasury and the House of Commons Library confirm that the defence budget will be cut by £2 . 5 billion in cash terms in this next financial year . The 2 . 5 % of GDP , which the Minister referred to , was not mentioned once in the Treasury Red Book ; the last time this country spent 2 . 5 % of GDP on defence was in 2010 under a Labour Government . While Putin wages war in Europe , Ministers are warring with each other . Challenging defence policy in public , the Minister for Security was on TV this morning calling for 2 . 5 % now . That is a serious breakdown in collective ministerial responsibility , but I am most concerned about the serious state of the UK armed forces . What signal does it send to our adversaries when our forces have been hollowed out and underfunded for the last 14 years ; when the Public Accounts Committee finds the largest ever funding deficit in the MOD ’ s equipment plans ; when the British Army has been cut to its smallest size since Napoleon ; when forces recruitment targets have been missed each and every year for 14 years ; and when satisfaction with service life has hit a record low ? I have one simple question for the Minister : where is the plan for better defending Britain ? It is clear that our armed forces cannot afford another five years of a Conservative Government . I am grateful to the right hon . Gentleman for his comments about HMS Richmond . I am sure that we all agree and pay tribute to our Royal Navy personnel , who are there ultimately to defend not only themselves but freedom of navigation for the rest of the world . We should recognise the importance of the role that they are undertaking on behalf of our Government . The right hon . Gentleman talked about the funding for next year . To be clear , that will represent a 1 . 8 % increase in real terms and not the cut that he suggested . If we spend the money that we expect , it will amount to £55 . 6 billion — about 2 . 3 % of GDP , which is traditionally how we measure our spending . That is significantly above the just under 2 . 1 % in 2019 , so it is a significant increase as a percentage of GDP . The right hon . Gentleman also talked about recruitment , which is an important issue . My right hon . Friend the Minister for Defence People and Families is doing a lot of work on that and , as the right hon . Gentleman will be aware , in January we saw the highest number of applications to the Army in six years . A more positive picture is developing , recognising the importance of the mission . We should not talk down our armed forces when we expect people to apply and to want to be recruited into them . I note the range of comments about the 2 . 5 % and want to make several points . The first is that the right hon . Gentleman said that we had not spent that percentage since Labour were in power .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-11.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-11.txt"}, {"score": 0.6090879440307617, "chunk_id": "debates2025-09-08_F6", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-09-08.txt", "date": "2025-09-08", "parliament": "UK", "text": "On defence spending , can the Secretary of State confirm what percentage of GDP will be used to set the cost envelope for the defence investment plan ? When we settle our defence investment plan and produce our annual report and accounts , the data that the hon . Gentleman seeks will be set out clearly and in the customary way to this House . Interestingly , the answer is not 3 . 5 % , it is not 3 % , and it is not even 2 . 6 % — those are the figures we declare to NATO ; they are not from the Ministry of Defence budget . As the then armed forces Minister , the hon . Member for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport , confirmed to me last week in a written answer , the amount we will spend on the defence investment plan comes entirely from the MOD ’ s departmental budget . Therefore , the actual figure for funding our future defence equipment is just 2 . 2 % by 2027 , with no funded plans to go any higher . Given the threats we face , is 2 . 2 % enough ? It should come as no surprise to anyone that the defence investment plan will be funded from the defence budget . That is exactly what will happen . It will be funded and supported by the record increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war — by the £5 billion extra in this year ’ s Budget — with an aim to spend 3 % of GDP on defence during the next Parliament . These are commitments that the previous Conservative Government had 14 years to make , but never made . This is a Government who are delivering for defence and delivering for Britain . Whether he plans to implement the outstanding recommendations of the second report of the Defence Committee of Session 2021 - 22 , “ Protecting those who protect us : Women in the Armed Forces from Recruitment to Civilian Life ” , HC 154 . Defence as a whole has accepted 33 recommendations from the “ Women in the Armed Forces ” report . We have two outstanding elements still in train : the results of an armed forces sexual harassment survey , and a veterans strategy with a specific female veterans section . Both will be released in the autumn . On top of this , we have a tri - service complaints system — which I personally brought in — and the violence against women and girls taskforce , to make sure that any woman can serve with safety and pride . The Atherton report , published in 2021 , surveyed 4 , 000 female service personnel and veterans . It revealed that 62 % had been victims of bullying , discrimination , harassment or sexual assault during their service . Does the Minister recognise that at a time when we are expanding our armed forces , we must improve the overall experience of women in the military , protect female personnel , and help servicewomen achieve their full potential ? I could not agree more with the hon . Member . Obviously , in our Minister for the armed forces , my hon . Friend the Member for North East Derbyshire ( Louise Sandher - Jones ) , we have an individual who has lived experience of being a female in the armed forces . It is really important to mention the individual who sits at the bottom of the command chain — where do they go if they are experiencing a problem ? Where do they seek help , and who do they complain to ? In some cases , they cannot do it within the chain of command .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-08.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-08.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2024-03-11.txt | debates2024-03-11_F21 | 2024-03-11 | UK", "debates2024-03-11.txt | debates2024-03-11_F22 | 2024-03-11 | UK", "debates2024-03-11.txt | debates2024-03-11_F28 | 2024-03-11 | UK", "debates2024-03-11.txt | debates2024-03-11_F34 | 2024-03-11 | UK", "debates2024-11-11.txt | debates2024-11-11_F28 | 2024-11-11 | UK", "debates2024-11-26.txt | debates2024-11-26_F15 | 2024-11-26 | UK", "debates2025-02-25.txt | debates2025-02-25_F24 | 2025-02-25 | UK", "debates2025-09-08.txt | debates2025-09-08_F6 | 2025-09-08 | UK"], "answer": "The speech dates are: 2024-03-11, 2024-11-11, 2024-11-26, 2025-02-25, 2025-09-08.

I thank the hon . Gentleman for his intervention . I wish I had all the answers to his questions , because I am sure it would have saved us time . It is now six minutes to 11 , and I could have had a longer breakfast . Duplicating things for one part of the country does not solve a problem ; it creates one . If the SNP cannot manage a shipbuilding contract without going £260 million over budget , what makes us think it would manage immigration efficiently or affordably ? Will the hon . Member give way ? I will make slightly more progress and then give way . The Bill proposes the devolution of immigration powers to the Scottish Government , under the argument that economic migration could support rural and island communities . Let me be absolutely clear : I agree that migration , when done properly , can be a lifeline . It can bring new energy to struggling areas , provide vital workers and enrich our communities . But this Bill , with all the good will in the world , fails to offer the security , clarity or accountability needed to deliver those outcomes . When I came into this debate , I did not expect the main thrust of the Labour party ’ s argument to be a concession that it will not win the next Holyrood election . Labour Members have consistently said that this is about handing powers to the SNP . Do they understand how democracy works ? Or are they looking at the polls and saying , “ Oh my goodness , we are totally in trouble before 2026 , so it ’ s got to be an SNP Government next year ” ? That is a bit of a reach . How will the Scottish Government manage border security between England and Scotland ? How will they ensure consistency with UK immigration policy ? How will they safeguard against misuse or confusion about legal status ? These questions remain unanswered , and regrettably this Bill would create far more uncertainty than solutions . Is my hon . Friend aware that the Scottish National party ’ s own Minister for independence has let the cat out of the bag and said that border checks were expected to be a “ hard reality ” in the future ? Does my hon . Friend agree that this Bill , in its one sentence , is the Trojan horse that will bring forward that hard reality ? I was not aware of that , but I think that this one - sentence Bill is probably the SNP ’ s hard border to getting any further . Above all , the most pressing question is this . Before those in the SNP ask for more powers , why not first demonstrate that they can effectively use the powers they already have ? Before reaching for immigration levers — hon . Members can all finish this line for me — fix the ferries . Before seeking new authority , show that they can deliver on their current responsibilities . Whether we are talking about those in the Outer Hebrides , the Isle of Wight , or any of the countless communities that feel overlooked and underserved , the people across Scotland deserve far better than what they have received so far . They deserve competent leadership , not constant excuses . They deserve joined - up policies that work , not duplications and distractions . They deserve public services that are strong and reliable , not stretched to the brink . Above all , they deserve Governments at every level that are honest about what they can deliver and accountable when they do not .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-04-25.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-04-25.txt"}, {"score": 31.646077837777174, "chunk_id": "debates2024-12-04_F10", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-12-04.txt", "date": "2024-12-04", "parliament": "UK", "text": "I call the Leader of the Opposition . I pay tribute to Mandy Damari and her family for the strength they have shown . We on this side of the House , and I am sure the whole House , continue to seek the speedy release of Emily Damari and the other hostages . The Prime Minister talks about immigration , so it is probably a good time to remind him that he was the one writing letters asking us not to deport foreign criminals . He and his party voted against every single measure we put in place to try to limit immigration . The question today is what has been on the lips of all Labour MPs , including , I believe , the Health Secretary yesterday . The Prime Minister knowingly appointed a convicted fraudster to be his Transport Secretary . What was he thinking ? The previous Transport Secretary was right to resign when further information came forward . What a marked contrast to the behaviour of the last 14 years . The Leader of the Opposition talks about immigration . There were record levels of immigration under the previous Government , with net migration of nearly 1 million , and she was the cheerleader . She was the one urging the removal of the caps on work visas . She thanked the previous Home Secretary for the work that was done . She championed it , she advocated it — record levels of immigration . He is obfuscating , but I am going to keep him on the topic . He owes the House an explanation . He says that the former Transport Secretary was asked to resign only after further information came to light . What was that further information ? I am not going to disclose private conversations . Further information came to light , and the Transport Secretary resigned . What a marked contrast . While the right hon . Lady is obsessing with Westminster issues , we are getting on with fixing the mess and fixing the foundations , with that £22 billion black hole , our prisons bursting and , as we found out last week , net migration of nearly 1 million because of the Tory open borders policy . I am not asking about migration ; I am asking about the former Transport Secretary . He never answers any questions , and it looks like he did not ask his Transport Secretary any questions either . The truth is that he appointed a person convicted of fraud to the Cabinet , and the first thing she did was bung hundreds of millions of pounds in pay rises to her trade union friends . Was this not a fraud on the British people ? No . She says she is not talking about immigration , and I am not surprised . I advise her not to talk about the economy or immigration for another five years . He can try to change the topic as much as he likes , but the public are watching . He owes them an explanation . The country needs conviction politicians , not politicians with convictions . Now , on to an even bigger fraud : the Budget . Last week , the Prime Minister failed to repeat the Chancellor ’ s pledge of no more borrowing and no more taxes . It is obvious that they are coming back for more . In his manifesto , he committed to making Britain the fastest - growing economy in the G7 . Does he stand by his own pledge ? I gently remind the right hon .

I seem to have quite lost my way after your intervention , Mr Speaker , but let me return to the main thrust of the argument that I was making a few moments ago . We are a serious Government who are a serious partner for the private sector , which is why we are investing in things that will get our country moving again . It is early days ; the damage that the Tories did will take time to unpick and there will be more difficult decisions ahead , but since we came to power , this Government have announced £250 billion of new investment commitments , creating tens of thousands of jobs . The Bank of England has cut interest rates five times , meaning that someone on a tracker mortgage of just over £200 , 000 is already around £100 a month better off . We have cut red tape and changed planning regulations so that we can deliver 1 . 5 million new homes over the course of this Parliament . We have acted to accelerate the construction of nearly 100 , 000 new homes , which were previously stuck . We were the fastest - growing G7 economy in the first half of this year . Most telling of all , since the general election real wages have risen by more than they did in the first 10 years of the Conservative Government .

I thank the hon . Gentleman for his intervention . I wish I had all the answers to his questions , because I am sure it would have saved us time . It is now six minutes to 11 , and I could have had a longer breakfast . Duplicating things for one part of the country does not solve a problem ; it creates one . If the SNP cannot manage a shipbuilding contract without going £260 million over budget , what makes us think it would manage immigration efficiently or affordably ? Will the hon . Member give way ? I will make slightly more progress and then give way . The Bill proposes the devolution of immigration powers to the Scottish Government , under the argument that economic migration could support rural and island communities . Let me be absolutely clear : I agree that migration , when done properly , can be a lifeline . It can bring new energy to struggling areas , provide vital workers and enrich our communities . But this Bill , with all the good will in the world , fails to offer the security , clarity or accountability needed to deliver those outcomes . When I came into this debate , I did not expect the main thrust of the Labour party ’ s argument to be a concession that it will not win the next Holyrood election . Labour Members have consistently said that this is about handing powers to the SNP . Do they understand how democracy works ? Or are they looking at the polls and saying , “ Oh my goodness , we are totally in trouble before 2026 , so it ’ s got to be an SNP Government next year ” ? That is a bit of a reach . How will the Scottish Government manage border security between England and Scotland ? How will they ensure consistency with UK immigration policy ? How will they safeguard against misuse or confusion about legal status ? These questions remain unanswered , and regrettably this Bill would create far more uncertainty than solutions . Is my hon . Friend aware that the Scottish National party ’ s own Minister for independence has let the cat out of the bag and said that border checks were expected to be a “ hard reality ” in the future ? Does my hon . Friend agree that this Bill , in its one sentence , is the Trojan horse that will bring forward that hard reality ? I was not aware of that , but I think that this one - sentence Bill is probably the SNP ’ s hard border to getting any further . Above all , the most pressing question is this . Before those in the SNP ask for more powers , why not first demonstrate that they can effectively use the powers they already have ? Before reaching for immigration levers — hon . Members can all finish this line for me — fix the ferries . Before seeking new authority , show that they can deliver on their current responsibilities . Whether we are talking about those in the Outer Hebrides , the Isle of Wight , or any of the countless communities that feel overlooked and underserved , the people across Scotland deserve far better than what they have received so far . They deserve competent leadership , not constant excuses . They deserve joined - up policies that work , not duplications and distractions . They deserve public services that are strong and reliable , not stretched to the brink . Above all , they deserve Governments at every level that are honest about what they can deliver and accountable when they do not .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-04-25.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-04-25.txt"}, {"score": 31.646077837777174, "chunk_id": "debates2024-12-04_F10", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-12-04.txt", "date": "2024-12-04", "parliament": "UK", "text": "I call the Leader of the Opposition .

The Prime Minister talks about immigration , so it is probably a good time to remind him that he was the one writing letters asking us not to deport foreign criminals . He and his party voted against every single measure we put in place to try to limit immigration . The question today is what has been on the lips of all Labour MPs , including , I believe , the Health Secretary yesterday . The Prime Minister knowingly appointed a convicted fraudster to be his Transport Secretary . What was he thinking ? The previous Transport Secretary was right to resign when further information came forward . What a marked contrast to the behaviour of the last 14 years . The Leader of the Opposition talks about immigration . There were record levels of immigration under the previous Government , with net migration of nearly 1 million , and she was the cheerleader . She was the one urging the removal of the caps on work visas . She thanked the previous Home Secretary for the work that was done . She championed it , she advocated it — record levels of immigration . He is obfuscating , but I am going to keep him on the topic . He owes the House an explanation . He says that the former Transport Secretary was asked to resign only after further information came to light . What was that further information ? I am not going to disclose private conversations . Further information came to light , and the Transport Secretary resigned . What a marked contrast . While the right hon . Lady is obsessing with Westminster issues , we are getting on with fixing the mess and fixing the foundations , with that £22 billion black hole , our prisons bursting and , as we found out last week , net migration of nearly 1 million because of the Tory open borders policy . I am not asking about migration ; I am asking about the former Transport Secretary . He never answers any questions , and it looks like he did not ask his Transport Secretary any questions either . The truth is that he appointed a person convicted of fraud to the Cabinet , and the first thing she did was bung hundreds of millions of pounds in pay rises to her trade union friends . Was this not a fraud on the British people ? No . She says she is not talking about immigration , and I am not surprised . I advise her not to talk about the economy or immigration for another five years . He can try to change the topic as much as he likes , but the public are watching . He owes them an explanation . The country needs conviction politicians , not politicians with convictions . Now , on to an even bigger fraud : the Budget . Last week , the Prime Minister failed to repeat the Chancellor ’ s pledge of no more borrowing and no more taxes . It is obvious that they are coming back for more . In his manifesto , he committed to making Britain the fastest - growing economy in the G7 . Does he stand by his own pledge ? I gently remind the right hon .

I seem to have quite lost my way after your intervention , Mr Speaker , but let me return to the main thrust of the argument that I was making a few moments ago . We are a serious Government who are a serious partner for the private sector , which is why we are investing in things that will get our country moving again . It is early days ; the damage that the Tories did will take time to unpick and there will be more difficult decisions ahead , but since we came to power , this Government have announced £250 billion of new investment commitments , creating tens of thousands of jobs . The Bank of England has cut interest rates five times , meaning that someone on a tracker mortgage of just over £200 , 000 is already around £100 a month better off . We have cut red tape and changed planning regulations so that we can deliver 1 . 5 million new homes over the course of this Parliament . We have acted to accelerate the construction of nearly 100 , 000 new homes , which were previously stuck . We were the fastest - growing G7 economy in the first half of this year . Most telling of all , since the general election real wages have risen by more than they did in the first 10 years of the Conservative Government .

He is now a British citizen . This is precisely why we need to break the conveyor belt — from arriving in the UK to acquiring indefinite leave to remain and then a British passport , and now a right to bring six family members here as well . Just last week , the Prime Minister bizarrely claimed that a British passport was not a pull factor for those coming to the UK .

I call the Leader of the Opposition . Last week , the Prime Minister did not seem to want to talk about appointing fraudsters to his Cabinet . In fact , he seemed to want to talk about immigration , so let us talk about immigration . He has relaunched yet again , with many new targets , six milestones and five missions , but why was cutting immigration not a priority ? I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition now wants to talk about immigration . Last week , she said that she did not want to — and for good reason , because the previous Government presided over record high levels of immigration . The figures just a few weeks ago showed net migration of nearly 1 million . That is unprecedented — a one nation experiment in open borders under the last Government . She was the champion ; she stood up and praised the then Tory Home Secretary for listening to her on removing caps on migration visas . She was applauding it . Now , she is furious about what she was campaigning for . We will drive down lawful migration ; we will drive down illegal migration . The Prime Minister talks about open borders , but he was the one campaigning for free movement . I was , in this House , asking for a lift in skilled migration ; he was supporting all the people who should not have been in this country . He wanted us to relax immigration , but as he is so keen to talk about the past , let us look at his record . Four years ago , the Prime Minister signed a letter demanding that foreign criminals be allowed to stay in Britain . Dozens of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs repeatedly signed these letters , insisting that rapists and murderers be allowed to stay here . One of those criminals , Ernesto Elliott , had 17 convictions , including for knife crime . After his deportation was blocked , Elliott went on to murder someone . He was able to stay here and murder because people like this man campaigned against deporting criminals . Will he apologise for signing these letters ? First , I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the number of migrants coming to this country under her Government ’ s watch — nearly 1 million — was over four times the number who did so when we were in the EU . They lost control of the borders , and the particular example she puts to me is an example of failure , under her Government , to take the necessary measures to keep our country safe . That is a ludicrous assertion . The Prime Minister is the one who was repeatedly signing those letters . He even asked us to pause all deportations . He does not want to talk about his past , but that letter is just the tip of the iceberg ; there is more . The Prime Minister actually complained that the immigration system was working to “ deter migrants rather than provide support . ” He said that he was “ proud to have served as Jeremy ’ s Shadow Immigration Minister ” . He boasted that he “ took the last Labour Government to court for cutting benefits for asylum seekers ” , and said that he would never take “ a target - based approach to immigration . ” If he wants to talk about immigration , let us talk about his record ; we can talk about it all day .

One Labour peer , Lord Glasman , has called him “ the absolute archetype of an arrogant , progressive fool ” . If we are serious about protecting our borders , we need to make sure that we appoint people who believe in our country and everything we stand for . It is not clear that the Attorney General does . The Government are now recruiting a new chief inspector of borders , who lives in Finland and wants to work from home .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-02-12.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-02-12.txt"}, {"score": 31.100638525275244, "chunk_id": "debates2024-12-11_F9", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-12-11.txt", "date": "2024-12-11", "parliament": "UK", "text": "I was proud to see the work on the carbon capture cluster in Teesside , which will create 2 , 000 new jobs . I call the Leader of the Opposition . Last week , the Prime Minister did not seem to want to talk about appointing fraudsters to his Cabinet . In fact , he seemed to want to talk about immigration , so let us talk about immigration . He has relaunched yet again , with many new targets , six milestones and five missions , but why was cutting immigration not a priority ? I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition now wants to talk about immigration . Last week , she said that she did not want to — and for good reason , because the previous Government presided over record high levels of immigration . The figures just a few weeks ago showed net migration of nearly 1 million . That is unprecedented — a one nation experiment in open borders under the last Government . She was the champion ; she stood up and praised the then Tory Home Secretary for listening to her on removing caps on migration visas . She was applauding it . Now , she is furious about what she was campaigning for . We will drive down lawful migration ; we will drive down illegal migration . The Prime Minister talks about open borders , but he was the one campaigning for free movement . I was , in this House , asking for a lift in skilled migration ; he was supporting all the people who should not have been in this country . He wanted us to relax immigration , but as he is so keen to talk about the past , let us look at his record . Four years ago , the Prime Minister signed a letter demanding that foreign criminals be allowed to stay in Britain . Dozens of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs repeatedly signed these letters , insisting that rapists and murderers be allowed to stay here . One of those criminals , Ernesto Elliott , had 17 convictions , including for knife crime . After his deportation was blocked , Elliott went on to murder someone . He was able to stay here and murder because people like this man campaigned against deporting criminals . Will he apologise for signing these letters ? First , I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the number of migrants coming to this country under her Government ’ s watch — nearly 1 million — was over four times the number who did so when we were in the EU . They lost control of the borders , and the particular example she puts to me is an example of failure , under her Government , to take the necessary measures to keep our country safe . That is a ludicrous assertion . The Prime Minister is the one who was repeatedly signing those letters . He even asked us to pause all deportations . He does not want to talk about his past , but that letter is just the tip of the iceberg ; there is more . The Prime Minister actually complained that the immigration system was working to “ deter migrants rather than provide support . ” He said that he was “ proud to have served as Jeremy ’ s Shadow Immigration Minister ” . He boasted that he “ took the last Labour Government to court for cutting benefits for asylum seekers ” , and said that he would never take “ a target - based approach to immigration . ” If he wants to talk about immigration , let us talk about his record ; we can talk about it all day . The Prime Minister says that he wants to talk about immigration .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-12-11.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-12-11.txt"}, {"score": 31.007523625153517, "chunk_id": "debates2025-06-30_F23", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-06-30.txt", "date": "2025-06-30", "parliament": "UK", "text": "5 billion of a £100 billion bill by introducing a two - tier system . Two people diagnosed with Parkinson ’ s a week apart will now receive different levels of support — all to clear up an internal Labour argument . The Government ’ s own impact assessment shows that these plans will not get a single person into work . The idea that work is the guiding motivation for these changes is laughable . There are things that the Government could do . They could reform the fit note system , which sees 94 % of people who apply told that they are too sick to do any work at all . They could say today that they would make all sickness benefit assessments face to face . They could get a grip of the rising claims for common mental health problems , such as anxiety and depression . Claims for those and neurodevelopmental conditions such as ADHD are the main reason for the steep rise in the number of people on sickness benefits , making up more than half of all new claims . The Centre for Social Justice has found that the Government could save up to £9 billion by reforming those benefits . However , nothing that we have seen from Labour over the past couple of weeks suggests that it has the courage and conviction to grip that problem . In the meantime , our welfare bill will only continue to rise . We agree on the need for reform and have set out the conditions under which we would support the Government : first , the welfare budget must come down ; secondly , we need to get people back into work ; thirdly , there must be no new tax rises to pay for increases in welfare spending . But with the welfare bill ever growing , unemployment rising and jobs disappearing , the Bill fails on all accounts . Will the Secretary of State confirm whether the changes she is announcing today will be paid for through borrowing or taxation ? Where are these good jobs she claims to be creating , when vacancies are going down and unemployment is going up ? Has she read the impact assessment for the Government ’ s Employment Rights Bill , which makes it clear that it will be harder for people to find work as a result ? Why did it take the Government a year to publish the terms of reference for their PIP assessment review , and when can we expect changes if it does not report back until autumn 2026 ? Could I try one more time to ask what the difference is between the Secretary of State ’ s right to try guarantee and our chance to work guarantee ? Finally , is this it ? Are there any more savings ? Are the Government not going to get any more people into work ? Is this the extent of their ambition for reforming the welfare system during their time in office ? In five years ’ time , will this be the Secretary of State ’ s legacy ? I am in listening mode , and I listened carefully to what the hon . Lady said : once again , her strategy seems to be to rail against the problems that she and her party created . She has some chutzpah to talk about a two - tier system , when that is precisely what the Conservatives introduced when they protected people on legacy benefits when they moved on to UC and replaced DLA with PIP . They were part of that , and the hon . Lady should admit that rather than making those points . She said we should bring back face - to - face reassessments . We are doing so — it was the Conservatives who switched them off .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-06-30.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-06-30.txt"}, {"score": 30.981962901040603, "chunk_id": "debates2023-12-12_F30", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-12-12.txt", "date": "2023-12-12", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Those hundreds of millions of pounds could now be £400 million , and I would like whichever immigration Minister winds up today ’ s debate to explain whether this is now , in fact , a £400 million plan .

It could have been used to clear the backlog entirely , end hotel use and save us a further couple of billion pounds , or train 1 , 000 doctors or 4 , 500 nurses . Of course , if the Government manage to send people to Rwanda , they will have to spend further money , probably around £200 , 000 per person — perhaps the Minister could also confirm that figure . That is more than twice as much as it costs here in the UK , so can the Government confirm that by the time they have finished , close to half a billion pounds will have been paid to Rwanda for just a few hundred people , around 1 % of those arriving in the country ? The Court of Appeal has said that there is only capacity in Rwanda for around 100 people ; even the judge who agreed with the Government said that talk of thousands is “ political hyperbole ” . The asylum system in Rwanda is also limited : it has only processed an average of 100 people a year for the past three years , so at most , it will be a few hundred people . Some 56 , 000 people are in hotels , 100 , 000 applied for asylum last year and 160 , 000 are waiting in the backlog , so potentially less than 0 . 1 % of those people will be covered by the scheme . It is no wonder that the permanent secretary said yesterday : “ We don ’ t have evidence of a deterrent effect ” . The Government are now on their third new law in two years . The Home Secretary said that the Bill means “ if you enter Britain illegally , you will be detained and swiftly removed…to a safe third country , such as Rwanda ” — [ Official Report , 7 March 2023 ; Vol . 729 , c . 152 . ] — except that was not the current Home Secretary , but his predecessor , talking about the last Bill : the Illegal Migration Act 2023 , passed four months ago .

The Home Secretary has also said that the Bill will “ deter illegal entry into the UK ” — [ Official Report , 24 March 2021 ; Vol . 691 , c . 922 . ] and that anyone who arrives illegally will be sent “ to the country they arrived from or a safe third country ” , but that also was not this Home Secretary or this Bill : it was his predecessor but four , the right hon . Member for Witham ( Priti Patel ) , when she introduced the main provisions of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 , passed 18 months ago . The main section of that Act has been revoked because it made things worse .

I call the Leader of the Opposition . In an effort to hide from his failures , the Prime Minister spent this week arguing about an ancient relic that only a tiny minority of the British public have any interest in — but that ’ s enough about the Tory party . In 2019 , they all promised the country that they would control immigration , saying “ numbers will come down ” and “ the British people will be in control ” . How is it going ? Let me be crystal clear . The levels of migration are far too high and I am determined to bring them back down to sustainable levels . That is why we have asked the Migration Advisory Committee to review certain elements of the system . We are reviewing those findings and will bring forward next steps . Earlier this year , we announced the toughest action ever taken to reduce legal migration . The effects of that action are yet to be felt , but will impact 150 , 000 student dependants . Forecasts show that migration is likely to drop as a result . Up until this moment , all we have heard from the right hon . and learned Gentleman on this topic is a secret backroom deal with the EU that would see an additional 100 , 000 migrants here every year . Never mind the British Museum — it is the Prime Minister who has obviously lost his marbles . The Greek Prime Minister came to London to meet him : a fellow NATO member , an economic ally and one of our most important partners in tackling illegal immigration . Instead of using that meeting to discuss those serious issues , the Prime Minister tried to humiliate him and cancelled at the last minute . Why such small politics , Prime Minister ? Of course we are always happy to discuss important topics of substance with our allies , like tackling illegal migration or strengthening our security , but when it was clear that the purpose of the meeting was not to discuss substantive issues for the future but to grandstand and relitigate issues of the past , it was not appropriate . Furthermore , specific commitments and assurances on that topic were made to this country and then broken . It may seem alien to the right hon . and learned Gentleman , but in my view , when people make commitments , they should keep them . I discussed the economy , security and immigration with the Greek Prime Minister . I also told him we would not change the law regarding the marbles — it is not that difficult . The reality is simple : the Prime Minister has no plan on boat crossings and migration is at a record high . His policy is that companies can pay workers from abroad 20 % less than British workers and that has contributed to those record high immigration levels , has it not ? The right hon . and learned Gentleman talks about the boat crossings but has failed to notice that illegal boat crossings are down by a third this year , thanks to all the actions we have taken , which he opposed every single time they were raised .

Yes , but what do we all usually say to our children ? “ Things which are difficult are usually much more worthwhile seeking to attain than the easy , low - hanging fruit . ” Will the Bill come with costs ? Let us be frank : we must all be conscious that we have come through or are coming through a cost of living crisis , and inflation has eroded people ’ s ability to spend and fuel costs are high . But to those who simplistically say , “ Well , we can ’ t afford to do this ; now is not the right time in the economic cycle , ” I say , with the greatest of politeness : if not now , when ? I do not believe that we can afford not to do this . Failure to do so would be the longest suicide note in history for our species . On our coastline , there are places that are built below sea level — one thinks of Canvey Island — so this is not just something that is happening elsewhere , about which we should be slightly anxious but not at all concerned . Rising sea levels and other changes will affect us here at home as well . We need to be careful in our consideration of that .

To those who say , “ Hang on a moment , our emissions are not too bad , and we ’ ve got to look to China and everybody else , ” I say : pollution does not respect international boundaries . It moves on the tides and the winds . We have lulled ourselves into a false sense of security , because , in essence , we have exported the production of many of our commodities — needed , desired and wanted — overseas . We have said , “ Look , our manufacturing emissions have gone down , ” but the production of those products is still creating emissions elsewhere . There are some noble aims in the Bill that we should think about . Will the hon . Gentleman give way ? To my neighbour from West Dorset ? Of course . I thank my Dorset neighbour for giving way . As always , I find myself agreeing with a lot of what he says , not least on the cost of inaction being far greater than the cost of action . He makes many good points about the fact that we have outsourced our carbon emissions to places far away , but does he agree that we often fail to sell the opportunities around tackling climate change , especially for British businesses , such as those provided by tidal and wave technologies ? We should celebrate those opportunities . The Government talk about growth ; there is so much opportunity for growth in this sector , and we should do more .

CHUCK EDWARDS of north carolina in the house of representatives Friday , May 10 , 2024 Mr . EDWARDS . Mr . Speaker , I include in the Record the following newsletter to give an update to my constituents to bring awareness to the Equal Representation Act in addition to issues surrounding the border crisis , antisemitism and energy costs . Dear Friend , This week , I was successful in passing my fourth bill since serving in Congress , the Equal Representation Act . Our democracy depends on electoral integrity , and that includes fair and equal representation of American citizens . By requiring a citizenship question on the decennial census , the Equal Representation Act would make sure that only U . S . citizens - - those who have the right to vote - - are counted when apportioning the number of congressional seats and Electoral College votes that each state has . Including non - citizens in the count when divvying up the number of congressional seats for each state weakens Americans & # x27 ; representation . In fact , the Center for Immigration Studies found that California has more congressional seats than the population would otherwise allow , and New York has [ [ Page E480 ] ] four more , giving these states a greater influence in determining the direction of our country . We need guardrails to protect our democracy , and that includes making sure that American citizens - - and American citizens only - - are accurately represented in their federal government .

Speaker , I include in the Record the following newsletter to give an update to my constituents to bring awareness to the Equal Representation Act in addition to issues surrounding the border crisis , antisemitism and energy costs . Dear Friend , This week , I was successful in passing my fourth bill since serving in Congress , the Equal Representation Act . Our democracy depends on electoral integrity , and that includes fair and equal representation of American citizens . By requiring a citizenship question on the decennial census , the Equal Representation Act would make sure that only U . S . citizens - - those who have the right to vote - - are counted when apportioning the number of congressional seats and Electoral College votes that each state has . Including non - citizens in the count when divvying up the number of congressional seats for each state weakens Americans & # x27 ; representation . In fact , the Center for Immigration Studies found that California has more congressional seats than the population would otherwise allow , and New York has [ [ Page E480 ] ] four more , giving these states a greater influence in determining the direction of our country . We need guardrails to protect our democracy , and that includes making sure that American citizens - - and American citizens only - - are accurately represented in their federal government . It & # x27 ; s time to stop diluting the voice and votes of Americans and with the passage of my bill , it & # x27 ; s clear that many of my colleagues agree . Condemning the administration & # x27 ; s deadly border crisis A major reason we need to stop illegal immigrants from skewing representation numbers in our government is due to this administration & # x27 ; s disastrous open - border policies that have allowed more than 7 . 2 million illegal immigrants to enter our country through our southern border .

By requiring a citizenship question on the decennial census , the Equal Representation Act would make sure that only U . S . citizens - - those who have the right to vote - - are counted when apportioning the number of congressional seats and Electoral College votes that each state has . Including non - citizens in the count when divvying up the number of congressional seats for each state weakens Americans & # x27 ; representation . In fact , the Center for Immigration Studies found that California has more congressional seats than the population would otherwise allow , and New York has [ [ Page E480 ] ] four more , giving these states a greater influence in determining the direction of our country . We need guardrails to protect our democracy , and that includes making sure that American citizens - - and American citizens only - - are accurately represented in their federal government . It & # x27 ; s time to stop diluting the voice and votes of Americans and with the passage of my bill , it & # x27 ; s clear that many of my colleagues agree . Condemning the administration & # x27 ; s deadly border crisis A major reason we need to stop illegal immigrants from skewing representation numbers in our government is due to this administration & # x27 ; s disastrous open - border policies that have allowed more than 7 . 2 million illegal immigrants to enter our country through our southern border . That is more than the population of 36 states . President Biden inherited policies from President Trump that would have strengthened our border security . However , since Biden & # x27 ; s first day in office , he has reversed policies that were in place to stem the flow of illegal immigrants , and has undermined U . S . border security on more than 60 occasions . The House sent a strong message by passing H .

R . 2 would reimplement President Trump & # x27 ; s effective border policies and end this administration & # x27 ; s border crisis , which continues to jeopardize our national security and sovereignty . In fact , a record - breaking number of nationals from our adversary , China , are illegally crossing our border . In April , the Customs and Border Patrol found that in this fiscal year alone , they have encountered 27 , 583 Chinese nationals , a nearly 8 , 000 percent increase from fiscal year 2021 . With the rising threat of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , border security is paramount to national security and I will not relent in the fight to secure America & # x27 ; s borders . I recently spoke on the House floor about how the fentanyl pouring in through our borders has taken lives in our own communities in the mountains and urged that this administration put the American people first and close our southern border once and for all . The U . S . must stand with Israel As our ally , Israel , is defending itself from terrorist organizations , it is critical that we continue to stand with and support Israel . The president recently announced he would stop military aid to Israel at a time when this aid is needed to target Hamas terrorists and avoid more civilian casualties in what [ [ Page E563 ] ] looks like an attempt to appease the growing pro - Hamas sentiment among the left . In light of this administration & # x27 ; s misguided decision to halt military aid to Israel , a bipartisan group of colleagues and I demanded that the president provide answers on his decision to withhold shipments to Israel . Furthermore , the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) issued baseless arrest warrants for Israeli officials , equating them to the terrorists who committed the horrific attacks of Oct . 7 . The ICC & # x27 ; s decision is great news to terrorists around the globe and is a slap in the face to the only free - standing democracy in the Middle East . If I have my way , the United States will never abandon Israel , especially not while it is fighting for the right to exist and the rights of Jewish people everywhere , and no country should recognize any legitimacy of a pro - terrorist international court . Protecting Americans & # x27 ; right to financial privacy President Biden released a framework to evaluate the establishment of a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ) , which can be used as a surveillance tool and weaponized against the American people . In China , the Communist Party has been using a CBDC to track the spending habits of its citizens and we cannot allow this level of financial surveillance in America . That & # x27 ; s why I cast NC - 11 & # x27 ; s vote for the CBDC Anti - Surveillance State Act . This bill protects Americans & # x27 ; right to financial privacy by halting unelected bureaucrats from issuing a CBDC and is the first anti - central bank digital currency legislative effort ever introduced in Congress . WNC Backs the Blue During the past three years , the Defund the Police movement and anti - police policies have led to a surge in violent crime across the country . In the U . S . House of Representatives , we recently celebrated National Police Week and honored America & # x27 ; s law enforcement heroes by passing legislation to support our men and women in blue .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\US\\2024-05-24.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/US/2024-05-24.txt"}, {"score": 0.5000152587890625, "chunk_id": "2024-03-19_F11", "parent_id": null, "filename": "2024-03-19.txt", "date": "2024-03-19", "parliament": "US", "text": "Mr .

RUDY YAKYM III of indiana in the house of representatives Tuesday , March 19 , 2024 Mr . YAKYM . Mr . Speaker , I rise to recognize Julie Shambarger for the incredible work she has done to revitalize downtown Rochester , Indiana , by spearheading the effort to refurbish and reopen The Times Theater in Rochester . As is the case with so many venues on Main Streets across America , The Times Theater was an iconic symbol of Main Street Rochester before closing its doors in 2014 . Rather than accept The Times Theater & # x27 ; s apparent fate as a project of the past , Julie Shambarger poured her heart and soul into the mission of ensuring this cherished community fixture would be open for business and welcome visitors once again . Guided by her belief that The Times Theater could be restored as the vibrant heart of the Rochester community , Julie marshalled the effort to acquire the grants and donations needed to renovate The Times Theater so its reopening could be not only a possibility , but a reality . Today , The Times Theater is host to not only movies but also live music and community events , and it has welcomed over 9 , 000 guests since reopening last February . It has elevated the cultural landscape of Rochester and been a beacon of artistic innovation and creative expression . At a time when many of America & # x27 ; s social and civic ties are fraying , places like The Times Theater - - places the community can take pride in and congregate at - - are all the more important .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\US\\2024-03-19.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/US/2024-03-19.txt"}, {"score": 0.49594736099243164, "chunk_id": "2023-07-11_F8", "parent_id": null, "filename": "2023-07-11.txt", "date": "2023-07-11", "parliament": "US", "text": "I wish them all continued success in the years to come . < / pre > Title : PERSONAL EXPLANATION ; Congressional Record Vol . 169 , No . 118 Section : Extensions of Remarks Section Date : 2023 - 07 - 11 Volume : 169 , Issue : 118 Pages : E656 - E656 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = < pre > [ Extensions of Remarks ] [ Page E656 ] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ < a href = ' https : / / www . gpo . gov ' > www . gpo . gov < / a > ] PERSONAL EXPLANATION _ _ _ _ _ _ HON .

His statement supports bipartisan cooperation and suggests that his vote on the E-Bridge Act demonstrates a desire for continued success in addressing important issues, including possibly those related to immigration policy.\n\nHowever, regarding the specific immigration bill presented (E-Brige Act), there is no direct mention of its contents or arguments in the provided documents. Therefore, we can only make assumptions based on context and Mr. YAKYM's general support for the E-Bridge Act. The primary argument seems to be about supporting legislation that would facilitate bridge construction projects, which presumably includes issues related to infrastructure development, employment creation, and community revitalization.\n\nFor the broader context of immigration policies, there are no explicit arguments in favor or against such a policy; only Mr. POSEY's personal vote record is mentioned, which does not provide specific details about their stance on immigration policies.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T17:21:50"}

One beauty of our great country is its diversity , but with that comes causes for celebration throughout the year . My own community in South West Hertfordshire celebrates Diwali , Eid , Christmas , Chinese new year and other events , which often entails the use of fireworks . There is an expectation of fireworks and the noise associated with them at the main events of Christmas and new year , so pet owners inevitably take safeguarding measures then , but given the likelihood of fireworks throughout the year , may I urge the Minister to get on to this Bill quickly , ensuring that we do not stifle the celebrations , but that we do protect our animals and those vulnerable children who may be affected by noise ? I thank the hon . Member for his question . He is right to recognise that fireworks are used at a number of events throughout the year , but it would be wrong to characterise that as people having to expect that there will be noise . There is now a sufficient number of lower - decibel products on the market for everyone to act more responsibly , and we will be exploring that in our meetings over the coming weeks .

What progress his Department has made on developing an industrial strategy . What progress his Department has made on developing an industrial strategy . This Department and , indeed , Departments across Government are working extensively on developing our industrial strategy , which the Conservative party opposes , but which business and industry welcome . Last month , we launched the Industrial Strategy Advisory Council , comprising a very impressive group of the UK ’ s top business leaders , policy experts and trade union leaders . My right hon . Friends the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Business and Trade attended the council ’ s inaugural meeting on 17 December . In addition , we are currently analysing more than 3 , 000 responses to the Industrial Strategy Green Paper from businesses , academics , think - tanks and unions , and their insights and feedback are incredibly valuable as we develop the strategy . I strongly welcome the inclusion of defence in the draft industrial strategy and was pleased yesterday to host a roundtable in Sedgefield with the Minister for Defence Procurement and Industry . Many of the innovative small and medium - sized enterprises that we talked to spoke of the struggles that they have with red tape , bureaucracy and contracting with Departments across Whitehall . How will Ministers grab the opportunity of the industrial strategy to remove this red tape , which too often can thwart SME growth ? I am really pleased my hon . Friend held that roundtable . It is quite a turning point to have an industrial strategy with defence as one of the sectors ; building new relationships across Departments with colleagues who work in defence is a really powerful and important thing to do . He speaks to a wider problem face by a lot of industry when it comes to dealing with Government agencies and Departments . We are working hard to make these things easier , because growth is our priority and we have to break down those barriers .

The “ puritanical ZEV obsession ” was , as the hon . Gentleman knows , a Conservative policy from the last Government .

By contrast , Labour and the Government are acting with pragmatism . We are listening to industry and working at pace to get this right . We are also creating the conditions in which the automotive industry can thrive . That means delivering not just the economic and political stability so lacking under the previous Government , but an industrial strategy that will deliver growth , including in the automotive industry ; investing £2 billion in automotive transition through the Budget ; investing in research and development ; supporting and talking to our industries ; and understanding the global climate . It was really clear in BMW ’ s statement that there were macroeconomic global and commercial reasons why the decision to delay was made , but BMW is clear that it is still committed to this investment in the UK . I have talked to my right hon . Friend the Member for Oxford East ( Anneliese Dodds ) , who is liaising closely with workers and unions , as would be expected .

This Department and , indeed , Departments across Government are working extensively on developing our industrial strategy , which the Conservative party opposes , but which business and industry welcome . Last month , we launched the Industrial Strategy Advisory Council , comprising a very impressive group of the UK ’ s top business leaders , policy experts and trade union leaders . My right hon . Friends the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Business and Trade attended the council ’ s inaugural meeting on 17 December . In addition , we are currently analysing more than 3 , 000 responses to the Industrial Strategy Green Paper from businesses , academics , think - tanks and unions , and their insights and feedback are incredibly valuable as we develop the strategy . I strongly welcome the inclusion of defence in the draft industrial strategy and was pleased yesterday to host a roundtable in Sedgefield with the Minister for Defence Procurement and Industry . Many of the innovative small and medium - sized enterprises that we talked to spoke of the struggles that they have with red tape , bureaucracy and contracting with Departments across Whitehall . How will Ministers grab the opportunity of the industrial strategy to remove this red tape , which too often can thwart SME growth ? I am really pleased my hon . Friend held that roundtable . It is quite a turning point to have an industrial strategy with defence as one of the sectors ; building new relationships across Departments with colleagues who work in defence is a really powerful and important thing to do . He speaks to a wider problem face by a lot of industry when it comes to dealing with Government agencies and Departments . We are working hard to make these things easier , because growth is our priority and we have to break down those barriers .

I thank the Minister for her response , but with the cost of living pressures continuing , it is clear that delivering increased real incomes and better living standards is our No . 1 priority .

I welcome my hon . Friend ’ s support for sectoral collective bargaining and collective agreements as a key steer for improving living standards across workplaces in the country .

We fully support the work of the International Labour Organisation and will continue to meet our obligations under the ILO . What steps his Department is taking to improve the UK's trading relationships with other countries . This Government wasted no time when it came to trade deals — not just talking about them , but delivering them . We have already secured trade deals with the biggest economy in the world , one of the fastest - growing economies in the world , and our biggest trading market . The Government ’ s clear principle is to deliver for British businesses and the British people . That is why in the first month of my new role I travelled to three continents to further strengthen UK trade and investment . I welcome the Secretary of State to his place and invite him to Benbecula Distillery in my place . It is a dramatic lighthouse distillery , and a great addition to the landscape . It recently secured £1 . 5 million from the British Business Bank ’ s investment fund . Benbecula ’ s distillery is one of a chain of small distilleries across the Western Isles and other islands . I had a wee dram in Raasay , where that distillery has revived the island as much as its product revived me . What is the Secretary of State doing to make sure that this new wave of small Scottish distilleries will be part of the next round of trade deals ? I am extremely grateful for the invitation . I can reassure my hon . Friend that when we have the opportunity to take delegations abroad , the Scotch Whisky Association and representatives of those distilleries are always with us . We fight hard for the Scotch whisky business . We know how important it is right across the United Kingdom and to the UK ’ s economy overall . The week before last I was in India with the Prime Minister where we were furthering the trade deal we have secured and making sure that we exploit all the opportunities that these trade deals present . It is important to not only secure trade deals but make sure that we exploit all the opportunities right across the economy . That deal alone will unleash over £1 billion - worth of opportunities for the Scotch whisky industry , and that is something we should all celebrate .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-10-30.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-10-30.txt"}, {"score": 39.61604980495043, "chunk_id": "debates2025-03-12_F20", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-03-12.txt", "date": "2025-03-12", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Member for St Albans , “ would require the Secretary of State to publish a review on the impact of Part 4 of the Bill…on SMEs within 3 months of the passage of this Act . ” In the impact assessment , the Government have set out our initial plan for monitoring an evaluation of the impacts of the Bill , as well as some secondary legislation . I say this with the greatest respect to the hon . Lady : she has expressed concern about the burden on business , but if we had accepted all her party ’ s amendments yesterday , that would have added several billion pounds to the costs of businesses . The Liberal Democrats will have to decide , ideally tonight , whether they are in favour of workers ’ rights or not . Let me now deal with some of the amendments from the official Opposition . Amendment 297 seeks to “ increase , from seven to 14 days , the notice period that trade unions are required to adhere to when notifying employers that they plan to take industrial action . ” Our consultation on the creation of a modern framework for industrial relations sought views on what an appropriate notice period would be , recognising that the repeal of the Trade Union Act 2016 would reduce the notice period from 14 to seven days . The Government have listened carefully to the concerns expressed by respondents to the consultation who feared that a seven - day notice period would not provide enough time for unions to prepare for industrial action in some important sectors , such as transport , healthcare and education , with possible knock - on impacts on other services . The Government believe that employers should be given enough time to mitigate the most severe effects of industrial action , and acknowledge responses to the consultation arguing that seven days ’ notice was insufficient . Of course , we did have seven days ’ notice between 2010 and 2016 under the Tory Government . The Tories ’ lack of understanding of the Bill is clear from the number of times we heard that it would take us back to the 1970s , whereas in fact it will take us back to 2015 , when an earlier version of the Bill was introduced . The Government ’ s view is that 10 days provides the appropriate balance in enabling employers to mitigate the impact of industrial action and reduce disruption and the knock - on impacts of strikes , while also respecting the right to strike . Amendment 291 seeks to remove clause 52 , which deals with political funds and which , I think , prompted the most heated debate . It is notable that when it comes to reducing Tory red tape , it is only trade unions that do not receive the same benefits as everyone else . There has , I think , been a fundamental misunderstanding of what a trade union is . It is a member - based , democratic organisation designed to protect those who are part of it . Comparisons with Netflix subscriptions and insurance contracts are bogus , because they are not the same thing at all . Membership of a trade union and a political fund is not a subscription that people sign up to for a fixed period ; it is membership of a democratically organised and independent trade union , which they are free to leave at any time . Members have control of the organisation because it is democratically organised , and they can decide as a union whether to have a political fund at all .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-03-12.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-03-12.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2024-07-29.txt | debates2024-07-29_F0 | 2024-07-29 | UK", "debates2025-01-30.txt | debates2025-01-30_F2 | 2025-01-30 | UK", "debates2025-02-24.txt | debates2025-02-24_F21 | 2025-02-24 | UK", "debates2025-03-12.txt | debates2025-03-12_F20 | 2025-03-12 | UK", "debates2025-10-30.txt | debates2025-10-30_F12 | 2025-10-30 | UK"], "answer": "The context does not contain this information.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T17:22:30"}

This is yet another failure in the Government ’ s main aim of getting Britain growing again . Zero - emission vehicles are too expensive and , it appears , too hard to manufacture in the UK . That forces us into an unfortunate reality in which we are reliant on Elon Musk for our supply of EVs , and are funnelling money into his already very deep pockets , rather than promoting a productive domestic market with good jobs . We need to show ambition and make it easier for ordinary families to buy EVs . What measures will the Government take to support and encourage consumer demand for electric vehicles ? The hon . Gentleman talks about the Government ’ s policies for growing the economy . A few months ago , we held an international investment summit , at which £63 billion of investment was announced .

As such , our priority is ensuring that this process works effectively , which is why I am delighted that the Government have announced a £500 million investment in the first ever fair pay agreement in the social care sector . We will use what we learn to consider where fair pay agreements can offer similar benefits across other sectors . I thank the Minister for her response , but with the cost of living pressures continuing , it is clear that delivering increased real incomes and better living standards is our No . 1 priority . Can the Minister say a little more about which further sectors are most ready for fair pay agreements , and what steps the Department is taking to meet the UK ’ s obligations , as a member of the International Labour Organisation , to extend sectoral collective bargaining as a means to raise pay and improve living standards ? I welcome my hon . Friend ’ s support for sectoral collective bargaining and collective agreements as a key steer for improving living standards across workplaces in the country . As he knows , we are demonstrating our commitment to sectoral collective bargaining with the social care and school support staff sectors . The UK is committed to working internationally to strengthen workers ’ rights and enhance Labour standards globally . We fully support the work of the International Labour Organisation and will continue to meet our obligations under the ILO . What steps his Department is taking to improve the UK's trading relationships with other countries . This Government wasted no time when it came to trade deals — not just talking about them , but delivering them . We have already secured trade deals with the biggest economy in the world , one of the fastest - growing economies in the world , and our biggest trading market . The Government ’ s clear principle is to deliver for British businesses and the British people . That is why in the first month of my new role I travelled to three continents to further strengthen UK trade and investment . I welcome the Secretary of State to his place and invite him to Benbecula Distillery in my place . It is a dramatic lighthouse distillery , and a great addition to the landscape . It recently secured £1 . 5 million from the British Business Bank ’ s investment fund . Benbecula ’ s distillery is one of a chain of small distilleries across the Western Isles and other islands . I had a wee dram in Raasay , where that distillery has revived the island as much as its product revived me . What is the Secretary of State doing to make sure that this new wave of small Scottish distilleries will be part of the next round of trade deals ? I am extremely grateful for the invitation . I can reassure my hon . Friend that when we have the opportunity to take delegations abroad , the Scotch Whisky Association and representatives of those distilleries are always with us . We fight hard for the Scotch whisky business . We know how important it is right across the United Kingdom and to the UK ’ s economy overall . The week before last I was in India with the Prime Minister where we were furthering the trade deal we have secured and making sure that we exploit all the opportunities that these trade deals present . It is important to not only secure trade deals but make sure that we exploit all the opportunities right across the economy . That deal alone will unleash over £1 billion - worth of opportunities for the Scotch whisky industry , and that is something we should all celebrate .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-10-30.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-10-30.txt"}, {"score": 39.61604980495043, "chunk_id": "debates2025-03-12_F20", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-03-12.txt", "date": "2025-03-12", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Member for St Albans , “ would require the Secretary of State to publish a review on the impact of Part 4 of the Bill…on SMEs within 3 months of the passage of this Act . ” In the impact assessment , the Government have set out our initial plan for monitoring an evaluation of the impacts of the Bill , as well as some secondary legislation . I say this with the greatest respect to the hon . Lady : she has expressed concern about the burden on business , but if we had accepted all her party ’ s amendments yesterday , that would have added several billion pounds to the costs of businesses . The Liberal Democrats will have to decide , ideally tonight , whether they are in favour of workers ’ rights or not . Let me now deal with some of the amendments from the official Opposition . Amendment 297 seeks to “ increase , from seven to 14 days , the notice period that trade unions are required to adhere to when notifying employers that they plan to take industrial action . ” Our consultation on the creation of a modern framework for industrial relations sought views on what an appropriate notice period would be , recognising that the repeal of the Trade Union Act 2016 would reduce the notice period from 14 to seven days . The Government have listened carefully to the concerns expressed by respondents to the consultation who feared that a seven - day notice period would not provide enough time for unions to prepare for industrial action in some important sectors , such as transport , healthcare and education , with possible knock - on impacts on other services . The Government believe that employers should be given enough time to mitigate the most severe effects of industrial action , and acknowledge responses to the consultation arguing that seven days ’ notice was insufficient . Of course , we did have seven days ’ notice between 2010 and 2016 under the Tory Government . The Tories ’ lack of understanding of the Bill is clear from the number of times we heard that it would take us back to the 1970s , whereas in fact it will take us back to 2015 , when an earlier version of the Bill was introduced . The Government ’ s view is that 10 days provides the appropriate balance in enabling employers to mitigate the impact of industrial action and reduce disruption and the knock - on impacts of strikes , while also respecting the right to strike . Amendment 291 seeks to remove clause 52 , which deals with political funds and which , I think , prompted the most heated debate . It is notable that when it comes to reducing Tory red tape , it is only trade unions that do not receive the same benefits as everyone else . There has , I think , been a fundamental misunderstanding of what a trade union is . It is a member - based , democratic organisation designed to protect those who are part of it . Comparisons with Netflix subscriptions and insurance contracts are bogus , because they are not the same thing at all . Membership of a trade union and a political fund is not a subscription that people sign up to for a fixed period ; it is membership of a democratically organised and independent trade union , which they are free to leave at any time . Members have control of the organisation because it is democratically organised , and they can decide as a union whether to have a political fund at all .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-03-12.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-03-12.txt"}, {"score": 39.550756217919506, "chunk_id": "debates2025-06-26_F2", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-06-26.txt", "date": "2025-06-26", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Or did it not bother ? What will the Secretary of State be doing to ensure that our logistics sector is seen across Government as foundational to any growth mission ? It is my understanding that the logistics sector was pleased to be recognised as a case study in the industrial strategy . I know that it welcomed the announcement in the spending review of £590 million to progress the lower Thames crossing , which is a key strategic freight route . For many years the sector has been talking to us about improving the route from the south - east to the midlands and the north . Unlike the previous Government , this Government are finally getting on with the job . We have taken the planning decision to grant consent to the crossing and are making money available through the spending review to improve the country ’ s critical freight routes . The Secretary of State clearly has not listened to Logistics UK — I hope that at least she knows where the lower Thames crossing starts and ends . Let us turn to another foundational industry to transport and growth : fuel . Elizabeth de Jong , chief executive of Fuels Industry UK said about this week ’ s industrial strategy : “ we are disappointed not to be named explicitly as a ‘ foundational industry ’ today , given the vital role of the fuels sector in enabling growth ” . Why has our transport - critical fuels sector also been left behind by the Government ? This Government ’ s industrial strategy sets out the sectors that have the potential to deliver economic growth and for which are competing internationally for mobile capital investment . My colleague the Minister for the Future of Roads and I meet repeatedly with the industry , be that to discuss fuels or freight and logistics . We are determined to get our economy firing on all cylinders , and we know what critical role the sectors he talks about play in that . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . My party and I were pleased when the Chancellor recently announced funding for Northern Powerhouse Rail to improve connectivity . However , we still do not know on what the money will be spent . Any plan to boost the northern powerhouse must surely include a new main line between Manchester and Liverpool — a vital link that would not only drive economic growth across the north - west but strengthen connections between two of our greatest cities . When will we finally see the detail behind the Chancellor ’ s announcement , and will she meet with me and my hon . Friends the Members for Cheadle ( Mr Morrison ) and for Hazel Grove ( Lisa Smart ) to discuss proposals for the better linking of Manchester and Liverpool ? The mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool — Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram — have made a strong case for improving rail connectivity between their two great cities . The hon .

We are using our influence to unlock the full potential of women to participate in the economy — that includes working to include gender provisions in newly negotiated free trade agreements — and we are supporting women - led businesses to realise the benefits of trade . The developing countries trading scheme provides for 0 % tariffs , which disproportionately supports smaller , women - led businesses in low - income countries . I should like to know what steps the Foreign Office is taking to protect women and girls in this country . There can be no better candidates for deportation than non - UK nationals who have violently raped children here . After the Casey report into the gangs scandal last week , Ministers promised that they would do everything they could to deport the men involved . Will the Foreign Secretary confirm that he has already told Pakistan that British aid and diplomatic visas will be withdrawn if convicted rapists are not taken back ?

It is probably a question for the Home Office , but we in the Foreign Office will do anything we can to support victims and bring people to justice . I call the shadow Minister . Education is a basic right , and ensuring quality education for every girl is essential to building a more equitable world .

We have successfully implemented that suspension and have continued to refuse relevant licence applications . All export licences are kept under careful and continual review , and we can suspend , refuse or revoke licences as required . The war criminals of Benjamin Netanyahu ’ s Government are carrying out the most vile human rights abuse and genocide .

The Secretary of State and I were deeply saddened by the recent passing of former UTV political editor Ken Reid , who was a close follower of Northern Ireland oral questions . Our thoughts are with his family and his many peers across journalism . I recently attended the launch of Invest NI ’ s business innovation grant , which received £440 , 000 of UK Government funding . This will complement the Government ’ s work to target high - growth sectors in Northern Ireland , including the digital and technologies sector , through our industrial strategy . My constituency in Edinburgh has two universities , both of which do excellent work with our counterparts in Northern Ireland . Can the Minister tell us how the Government are working with universities to support innovation in Northern Ireland ? It is fantastic to hear of those close links , which are so important for innovation and business growth , in combination with the university sector . Northern Ireland ’ s universities are key partners in boosting innovation and growth ; for example , through the UK Government ’ s new deal for Northern Ireland , £11 million of funding is helping Queen ’ s University Belfast ’ s centre for secure information technologies to deliver a cyber - artificial intelligence hub — a leading cyber - security research centre . This investment is unlocking a further £4 . 5 million of investment from the private sector . Free trade across the UK single market , from major tech hubs in London , Edinburgh and Cardiff to smaller towns such as Weston - super - Mare , is vital to supporting innovation in Northern Ireland and across the UK . What steps is the Minister taking to streamline Northern Ireland ’ s ability to trade with all corners of the UK , and vice versa ? I thank my hon . Friend for raising that point and the connection to Weston - super - Mare . There is a lot of work that we can do to support innovation across the whole country , including through the business innovation grant that I mentioned , which is especially for small and medium - sized enterprises . It offers grants of up to £20 , 000 to enable those enterprises to come into the market . Beyond its excellent universities , Northern Ireland is home to major innovative businesses such as Wrightbus , Spirit AeroSystems and Harland & Wolff , which specialise respectively in hydrogen vehicles , composite wing and aerostructure manufacture , and modular construction and shipping . Given the economic importance of those businesses , can I ask the UK Government to look again at the future of the whole - site operation at Spirit , as well as at Harland & Wolff , to ensure that those investments and jobs stay in Northern Ireland ? I thank my hon . Friend for raising the important aspect of business innovation and for mentioning those businesses , which are important to Northern Ireland ’ s economy . We are working with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure the best outcome for Short Brothers and its staff in relation to Spirit .

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the National Farmers Union , in particular , have raised concerns that new tariffs negotiated with Mexico and Canada will leave farmers in the UK much more vulnerable to imported eggs , pork and chicken that are produced to standards that would be illegal in the UK . The Pesticide Action Network UK raised concerns acknowledged by the Trade and Agriculture Commission — concerns also raised by an hon . Friend behind me — that more food produced using pesticides banned in the UK will be imported into the UK New clause 7 would require Ministers to publish a plan to help businesses benefit from the new trade deal . It is striking that the Office for Budget Responsibility , in its recent Budget analysis , made it clear that trade will make a negligible contribution to growth through to 2028 under Conservative party plans . We remember that the Secretary of State was appointed and within weeks exports began to fall . Then the Minister of State was reappointed to the brief and exports fell even further . Who could possibly have expected that to happen ? Ministers have cut funding for trade missions led by business groups themselves , and cut funding for small and medium - sized enterprises to get to trade shows to open up new markets for themselves . The Government website for helping exporters is so poor that some firms use other countries ’ websites to find where there might be opportunities . Ministers could and should be doing a whole lot better to support our businesses to take advantage of any benefits in trade deals . New clause 7 would require Ministers , once the accession process is over , to publish a clear implementation plan to help businesses benefit from CPTPP . Preference utilisation rates for other trade deals certainly do not offer any grounds for complacency . Given that exports under the Conservative party have performed worse than every other member of the G7 bar Japan over the last decade , it was striking that the Chancellor had nothing to offer exporters and , strikingly , no mention of any plan to help British business exploit our coming membership of CPTPP in his recent Budget . For those reasons , I am sympathetic to new clause 10 , tabled by the hon . Member for Gordon ( Richard Thomson ) . On amendment 1 , as the Minister knows and as the hon . Member for Chesham and Amersham set out , there remain serious doubts from industry about whether the changes the Bill allows for in relation to the UK ’ s copyright framework are actually required . We have had different explanations for the changes from Ministers . At one point they were due to the CPTPP . On another occasion they were being made to comply with other international treaty obligations signed decades ago . What is clear is that the changes could have a significant impact on the ability of the music industry to support new British artists . Because of those concerns , Ministers were forced to bring forward a consultation on the changes . The consultation will not finish until after the Bill has completed its passage through both Houses . In the worst - case scenario estimated by the Intellectual Property Office , the changes could cost over £100 million . It is likely that Royal Assent will have been granted before we know the outcome of the consultation process . Ministers were forced to bring this issue forward , which I have to say is just the latest example of , at best , a half - hearted approach to the scrutiny of trade issues by those on the Treasury Bench .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-19.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-19.txt"}, {"score": 0.6025504469871521, "chunk_id": "debates2025-06-12_F0", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-06-12.txt", "date": "2025-06-12", "parliament": "UK", "text": "[Document date: 2025-06-12]\nBill read a Second time .

Friend behind me — that more food produced using pesticides banned in the UK will be imported into the UK New clause 7 would require Ministers to publish a plan to help businesses benefit from the new trade deal . It is striking that the Office for Budget Responsibility , in its recent Budget analysis , made it clear that trade will make a negligible contribution to growth through to 2028 under Conservative party plans . We remember that the Secretary of State was appointed and within weeks exports began to fall . Then the Minister of State was reappointed to the brief and exports fell even further . Who could possibly have expected that to happen ? Ministers have cut funding for trade missions led by business groups themselves , and cut funding for small and medium - sized enterprises to get to trade shows to open up new markets for themselves . The Government website for helping exporters is so poor that some firms use other countries ’ websites to find where there might be opportunities . Ministers could and should be doing a whole lot better to support our businesses to take advantage of any benefits in trade deals . New clause 7 would require Ministers , once the accession process is over , to publish a clear implementation plan to help businesses benefit from CPTPP . Preference utilisation rates for other trade deals certainly do not offer any grounds for complacency . Given that exports under the Conservative party have performed worse than every other member of the G7 bar Japan over the last decade , it was striking that the Chancellor had nothing to offer exporters and , strikingly , no mention of any plan to help British business exploit our coming membership of CPTPP in his recent Budget .

What is clear is that the changes could have a significant impact on the ability of the music industry to support new British artists . Because of those concerns , Ministers were forced to bring forward a consultation on the changes . The consultation will not finish until after the Bill has completed its passage through both Houses . In the worst - case scenario estimated by the Intellectual Property Office , the changes could cost over £100 million . It is likely that Royal Assent will have been granted before we know the outcome of the consultation process .

Labour ’ s £3 billion green steel plan will give our industry the bright future that other countries are offering their steel sectors . Labour believes in our steel ; why do this Government not ? I am not sure where Labour Members will get the money to fund that programme of work . I have not even got to the end of reading this paper but they will probably U - turn by the time I do , so I am not sure how sensible it is going to be . We have provided more than £1 billion for decarbonisation , unprecedented support to help with energy costs , and just recently , there was fantastic news from Celsa , when it was able to repay a Government loan of £30 million that we provided to them , sensibly spending taxpayers ’ money . There is and always has been support available . When it comes to procurement , it is absolutely right that we do everything we can to make sure that we have UK firms procuring UK steel . What recent assessment she has made of the potential impact of her Department ’ s trade policies on food prices . We recognise the important role that trade can play in improving food security . That is why our trade policy aims to help people to access good - quality and good - value food . Our free trade agreements help to remove market access barriers , supporting our importers and exporters . The new developing countries trading scheme , for example , reduces tariffs on nearly £1 . 4 billion - worth of agriculture goods , and we work with international partners , including at the World Trade Organisation , to remove trade barriers and strengthen the UK ’ s global food supply . I am grateful to the Minister for his answer , but Melissa Leach , the director of the Institute of Development Studies , has spoken about the need to increase access to affordable , nutritious food . She said : “ Over the last decade , charities have stepped in to plug the gaps left by the state but this is not an acceptable or sustainable way to address the growing prevalence of hunger ” . Does the Minister accept that his Government ’ s commitment to Brexit has led to increasing prices of food that is imported and has contributed to food poverty in the UK ? The hon . Gentleman will be well aware that food price inflation is not unique to the UK ; it is a global phenomenon that we all face . Actually , food price inflation peaked at 19 . 2 % in the EU and at 19 . 2 % in the UK , so we are facing the same problems . However , we have provided more than £94 billion - worth of support precisely to help the most vulnerable in society . There are many factors impacting food inflation , not least increasing global input costs , but surely the most important thing that my hon . Friend ’ s Department can do to shore up British agriculture and have a positive impact on food prices is to carry on , full speed ahead , getting the new trade deals that will see British first - class produce sold as a premium product worldwide . My hon . Friend is absolutely correct . It is really important that we have support across the House for these important trade deals .

Scotland ’ s goods exports to the US were worth over £3 . 7 billion last year , and scotch whisky exports were £971 million — the largest slice by value . If the Prime Minister cannot protect the UK and Scottish steel industries , how can Scottish people be sure that he will be able to protect our whisky industry from malicious US tariffs ? I can assure the House that we are in regular touch with the Scotch Whisky Association . We fully appreciate the significance and importance of that industry not just to Scotland but to the UK . As my right hon . Friend the Secretary of State said , we are well served by a serious Prime Minister in these serious times , which affords us the opportunity for a dialogue in trade frankly not available to other countries . I call the Chair of the Select Committee , Liam Byrne . President Trump ’ s new tariffs are double trouble for Britain ’ s steel and aluminium suppliers . They will dent £350 million of sales , but they also risk swamping the UK with over - subsidised Chinese steel diverted from America . What is the Secretary of State ’ s game plan now to redouble defences for our UK metal makers ? I am incredibly grateful to the Chair of the Business and Trade Committee for that question . He is right to say that the challenge here is not just the direct trade we have with the US , but the impact of trade diversion . He knows we already have 16 anti - dumping , anti - subsidy measures in place against 14 separate product categories . Once the annual tariff - free quota is hit , a 25 % tariff applies to those . I can tell him and the House today , though , that I will support UK Steel ’ s application to the Trade Remedies Authority for a review of the steel safeguards — we do have to think about what will be coming — and a new one for the aluminium sectors . I am sure that Ministers will join me in welcoming the £90 million investment by dairy firm Arla in the plant in my constituency , which will create up to 90 jobs . Does not that reinforce the fact that agriculture remains at the heart of the rural economy in constituencies such as mine ? Should not the Government be supporting that industry , rather than trying to destroy it ? I can assure the House that we do welcome the investment of which the right hon . Gentleman speaks . Speaking on behalf of the constituency of East Lothian , I recognise fully the importance of the rural economy and agriculture ’ s contribution thereto . That is why we are in regular dialogue with the NFU and other key stakeholders . Together with the Startup Coalition , I recently held a roundtable with brilliant local start - ups working out of Future Space at the University of the West of England . Issues that they have been facing for a long time include accessing the same opportunities and support for growth as larger businesses . Would the Minister please set out what support his Department will be providing so that our very smallest businesses can thrive too ? One of the big issues that small businesses wanting to scale up face is access to finance . We are actively working across Government on what else we can do to support businesses to get access to the finance they need , including through the British Business Bank .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-03-13.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-03-13.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2023-06-29.txt | debates2023-06-29_F2 | 2023-06-29 | UK", "debates2024-03-19.txt | debates2024-03-19_F3 | 2024-03-19 | UK", "debates2025-03-13.txt | debates2025-03-13_F18 | 2025-03-13 | UK", "debates2025-06-12.txt | debates2025-06-12_F0 | 2025-06-12 | UK", "debates2025-07-17.txt | debates2025-07-17_F6 | 2025-07-17 | UK"], "answer": "The three industrial sectors mentioned as the main victims of the new trade policy are UK steel, Scotch whisky, and agriculture.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T17:23:31"}

Will the Minister join me in visiting Alex Begg in Ayr to hear about the importance of trade deals to local businesses with global ambitions ? I pay tribute to the craftsmanship and global ambitions of Alex Begg in Ayr . My mother ’ s side of the family are all from Ayrshire , so it would be a personal pleasure to visit Ayrshire , as my hon . Friend suggests . I would suggest that we could visit Alex Begg during the summer recess , but then again , as Billy Connolly once observed : “ There are two seasons in Scotland : June and winter . ” Yesterday the Chancellor championed the Government ’ s supposed trade deal with the United States , but that trade deal is not yet complete . We know that because no impact assessment has been published . Why are the Government popping the champagne prematurely , and have they done an impact assessment on any of the ongoing negotiations ? I am grateful that at least one of the Opposition parties accepts that there is a deal . The hon . Member is right to recognise that the implementation phase is what we are now relentlessly focused on .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-06-12.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-06-12.txt"}, {"score": 0.586445689201355, "chunk_id": "debates2025-07-17_F6", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-07-17.txt", "date": "2025-07-17", "parliament": "UK", "text": "What assessment has the Department made of the potential impact of its trade strategy on British businesses , and in particular the ceramics industry ? I saw that the general secretary of the GMB was focused on exactly those issues in relation to the ceramics industry this week , and I applaud the concern he has shown for a key part of many local economies across the country . I assure my hon . Friend that we have given regard to every sector of the UK economy when negotiating the three trade deals secured by the Government — with the United States , as we just discussed , as well as with the European Union and , critically , with India . The United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 is a restrictive piece of legislation that centralises power to the UK Government and allows them to override the Scottish Parliament . Yesterday , the Labour Government confirmed they would not repeal or amend that Tory Act . Indeed , the Secretary of State for Scotland previously said that the Act was “ bad and damaging ” and undermined devolution , and the Business and Trade Secretary voted against it when in opposition . Will the Business and Trade Secretary confirm whether he would vote against it again now ? Does he agree with the Secretary of State for Scotland that this Tory Act is an attack on the integrity of the Scottish Parliament ? Well , well , well ; the grievance machine is being fired up again by the Scottish National party , even at the last Business and Trade questions . The reality is that the changes made to the United Kingdom Internal Market Act are proportionate , targeted and focused critically on supporting the many Scottish businesses that contributed to the consultation . I respectfully suggest to the hon . Gentleman that he should listen to Scottish business , which disproportionately benefits from the removal of barriers and the avoidance of new barriers going up in the critical single market that is the United Kingdom . What steps he is taking to support high street SMEs . What steps he is taking to support high street businesses . What steps he is taking to support high street businesses . To breathe life back into Britain ’ s high streets , we are addressing antisocial behaviour and crime , rolling out banking hubs , stamping out late payments , establishing a licensing taskforce , empowering communities to fill vacant properties and reforming the business rates system . There is more to do and our forthcoming small and medium enterprise strategy will set out further steps . Warrington South is home to brilliant businesses such as Gourmand ! , an award - winning French café , Mamars , a wonderful artisan bakery and deli , Hideout , which serves the best piña colada in Warrington — apparently — and the soon - to - open Zak ’ s Shack , a new parent and child - focused café in Stockton Heath . Such businesses are the beating heart of our town , built by local entrepreneurs who serve the community they love . However , set - up costs , business rates and other barriers make it harder for them to operate . Will the Minister outline how the Department specifically supports the independent hospitality and food retail sector ? My hon . Friend makes Warrington sound like a particularly attractive place for a Business Minister to visit , so if she does not mind , I will add that to the list of places that I am keen to visit . Independent businesses , as she rightly says , play an important role in supporting local growth and community cohesion .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-07-17.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-07-17.txt"}, {"score": 0.5854904651641846, "chunk_id": "debates2023-06-29_F2", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-06-29.txt", "date": "2023-06-29", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Meanwhile , UK steel producers pay 62 % more than their German counterparts for electricity . Labour ’ s £3 billion green steel plan will give our industry the bright future that other countries are offering their steel sectors . Labour believes in our steel ; why do this Government not ? I am not sure where Labour Members will get the money to fund that programme of work . I have not even got to the end of reading this paper but they will probably U - turn by the time I do , so I am not sure how sensible it is going to be . We have provided more than £1 billion for decarbonisation , unprecedented support to help with energy costs , and just recently , there was fantastic news from Celsa , when it was able to repay a Government loan of £30 million that we provided to them , sensibly spending taxpayers ’ money . There is and always has been support available . When it comes to procurement , it is absolutely right that we do everything we can to make sure that we have UK firms procuring UK steel . What recent assessment she has made of the potential impact of her Department ’ s trade policies on food prices . We recognise the important role that trade can play in improving food security . That is why our trade policy aims to help people to access good - quality and good - value food . Our free trade agreements help to remove market access barriers , supporting our importers and exporters . The new developing countries trading scheme , for example , reduces tariffs on nearly £1 . 4 billion - worth of agriculture goods , and we work with international partners , including at the World Trade Organisation , to remove trade barriers and strengthen the UK ’ s global food supply . I am grateful to the Minister for his answer , but Melissa Leach , the director of the Institute of Development Studies , has spoken about the need to increase access to affordable , nutritious food . She said : “ Over the last decade , charities have stepped in to plug the gaps left by the state but this is not an acceptable or sustainable way to address the growing prevalence of hunger ” . Does the Minister accept that his Government ’ s commitment to Brexit has led to increasing prices of food that is imported and has contributed to food poverty in the UK ? The hon . Gentleman will be well aware that food price inflation is not unique to the UK ; it is a global phenomenon that we all face . Actually , food price inflation peaked at 19 . 2 % in the EU and at 19 . 2 % in the UK , so we are facing the same problems . However , we have provided more than £94 billion - worth of support precisely to help the most vulnerable in society . There are many factors impacting food inflation , not least increasing global input costs , but surely the most important thing that my hon . Friend ’ s Department can do to shore up British agriculture and have a positive impact on food prices is to carry on , full speed ahead , getting the new trade deals that will see British first - class produce sold as a premium product worldwide . My hon . Friend is absolutely correct . It is really important that we have support across the House for these important trade deals .

Scotland ’ s goods exports to the US were worth over £3 . 7 billion last year , and scotch whisky exports were £971 million — the largest slice by value . If the Prime Minister cannot protect the UK and Scottish steel industries , how can Scottish people be sure that he will be able to protect our whisky industry from malicious US tariffs ? I can assure the House that we are in regular touch with the Scotch Whisky Association . We fully appreciate the significance and importance of that industry not just to Scotland but to the UK . As my right hon . Friend the Secretary of State said , we are well served by a serious Prime Minister in these serious times , which affords us the opportunity for a dialogue in trade frankly not available to other countries . I call the Chair of the Select Committee , Liam Byrne . President Trump ’ s new tariffs are double trouble for Britain ’ s steel and aluminium suppliers . They will dent £350 million of sales , but they also risk swamping the UK with over - subsidised Chinese steel diverted from America . What is the Secretary of State ’ s game plan now to redouble defences for our UK metal makers ? I am incredibly grateful to the Chair of the Business and Trade Committee for that question . He is right to say that the challenge here is not just the direct trade we have with the US , but the impact of trade diversion . He knows we already have 16 anti - dumping , anti - subsidy measures in place against 14 separate product categories . Once the annual tariff - free quota is hit , a 25 % tariff applies to those . I can tell him and the House today , though , that I will support UK Steel ’ s application to the Trade Remedies Authority for a review of the steel safeguards — we do have to think about what will be coming — and a new one for the aluminium sectors . I am sure that Ministers will join me in welcoming the £90 million investment by dairy firm Arla in the plant in my constituency , which will create up to 90 jobs . Does not that reinforce the fact that agriculture remains at the heart of the rural economy in constituencies such as mine ? Should not the Government be supporting that industry , rather than trying to destroy it ? I can assure the House that we do welcome the investment of which the right hon . Gentleman speaks . Speaking on behalf of the constituency of East Lothian , I recognise fully the importance of the rural economy and agriculture ’ s contribution thereto . That is why we are in regular dialogue with the NFU and other key stakeholders . Together with the Startup Coalition , I recently held a roundtable with brilliant local start - ups working out of Future Space at the University of the West of England . Issues that they have been facing for a long time include accessing the same opportunities and support for growth as larger businesses . Would the Minister please set out what support his Department will be providing so that our very smallest businesses can thrive too ?

Speculation around British Steel at the Scunthorpe plant is deeply concerning for the workers and business owners alike , who are desperately waiting for the Government to deliver just one piece of good news . Steel is vital to our green economy as it plays a huge role in our ability to extend our railways and to build zero carbon homes . What incentive does British Steel have to keep going ? It has had to contend with the Chancellor ’ s decision to hike national insurance contributions and with Trump ’ s terrifying tariffs . Manufacturing businesses need the Government to offer reassurance , certainty and stability . We need to move from a patchwork of last - minute rescues to a long - term plan that will see industry on a sustainable footing . We need a robust industrial strategy with a proper plan for steel within it . We have been told to expect this industrial strategy shortly . Will the Minister confirm exactly when we will have it ? Can she reassure the small and medium - sized manufacturing businesses in my constituency and across rural England that Britain wants them to grow ? Will the strategy include a long - term vision that will allow the UK to secure the investment that we need for virgin steel production ? I can reassure the hon . Lady that we are developing a long - term plan in the industrial strategy . We are developing the plan for steel , as I have said , and alongside that we have our trade strategy , which has become very significant in recent times . She is right to point to the tariffs that have been placed on steel and aluminium . This is a deeply difficult situation and I have met the steel sector on multiple occasions to talk about it . That is what the conversation that is happening in Stafford as we speak is about : what extra measures need to be put in place . The Secretary of State met the Trade Remedies Authority this morning to push on some of the issues around trade protections . The hon . Lady talked about the SME manufacturing supply chain . Of course that is very important and we will do what we can within the industrial strategy and the steel strategy to support those businesses . I understand that the speculation about what may or may not happen at Scunthorpe is deeply distressing , not just to the workers and their families but to all those who are part of the supply chain . That is why we will continue at pace to have the conversations we need to have with British Steel to ensure that we do the right thing , and as I said , nothing is off the table . The whole of northern Lincolnshire will feel the brunt of this British Steel decision , should the site close , and I urge Jingye to reconsider the Government ’ s generous £500 million offer . Support through the Department for Work and Pensions is really welcome but the truth is that people have been leaving British Steel for years because of the cycle of its uncertain future . I welcome the Government ’ s comment that no options are off the table . In the interim , are the Government considering ordering the raw materials to keep the blast furnaces burning ?

He is right that Immingham is the No . 1 port in terms of tonnage and is vital to our trade with the EU and the rest of the world . If our diaries allow , I or one of my Ministers will be delighted to visit and see at first hand the vital role Immingham plays in the transition to renewable energy . In December , the British Chambers of Commerce found that a staggering 97 % of surveyed businesses continued to face difficulties using the trade and co - operation agreement . Despite the TCA being introduced over three years ago , businesses are still struggling to deal with the added headache that the regulations have created . If 97 % of businesses still face difficulties after three years , how many years is it anticipated that it will take for these issues to be resolved ? I thank the hon . Lady for her question . Many of the issues that businesses have been raising with us are specific not to the TCA but to member countries . That is why Ministers and I , along with officials , go to all these countries , and we have removed many of the market access barriers , which are not specific to the TCA . The hon . Lady will know that the TCA will be up for review . If she has specific things she would like us to take to EU Trade Commissioners , we are very happy to do so . This week , the Financial Times reported the most significant decline in UK trade volumes since 1997 . It is clearer than ever that this Government ’ s hard Brexit policy has exacerbated challenges for British businesses . With a 7 . 4 % drop in trade since 2018 and exports down by 12 . 4 % , we are starkly lagging behind our G7 peers . Can the Secretary of State explain how 14 years of Conservative rule have prepared British businesses for their despair around extra red tape and the chaos unleashed by this Tory hard Brexit policy ? I think the hon . Gentleman has just time - travelled from 2018 or 2019 — it has been a long time since I have heard the phrase “ hard Brexit ” . He will of course know that we left the European Union with a deal , so he needs to catch up with what has actually happened . It is also interesting that he talked about an FT report from 1997 ; I should let him know that we have not been in government since 1997 — we have been in government since 2010 . Many of the things he is pointing out are things we have said will occur as trade flows move away from the European Union to the Indo - Pacific .

The trade and co - operation agreement has hit small and medium - sized exporters the hardest , as most do not individually have the capacity to deal with the additional bureaucracy and paperwork created by that trade deal . Does the Minister recognise that the TCA has disproportionately damaged the competitiveness of SMEs ? What support can the Government offer SMEs to recapture the market share they have lost in Europe since then ? There has not really been a loss in the market share . I have talked about what is happening internationally . We appreciate that small and medium - sized enterprises may not have the resources they need to export into new markets . That is why we have the UK Export Academy , international trade advisers , Help to Grow and the export support service . We are also looking at what trade barriers we can break down and bust to make it even easier for SMEs to access new markets through the trade deals secured by the Secretary of State . What steps she is taking to help support the steel industry . Our commitment to the UK steel sector is clear . The Government are contributing up to £500 million in a joint investment with Tata Steel . We are in talks with British Steel following our generous offers of support . We have delivered more than £730 million in energy costs relief since 2013 , and the British industry supercharger is coming soon . We updated our procurement policy note to ensure we are procuring more in the UK , and we are trying to do everything we can to continue to support the steel sector . We are all disappointed that the Government , having abandoned Teesside steel several years ago , are now ready to give up on primary steelmaking in the UK and to rely on recycled material utilising electric arc furnaces . I am pleased to hear that Teesside is pencilled in for one of them , but not so pleased that there have been attempts locally to circumvent proper procedures to secure planning consent . Will the Minister look into that ? More importantly , will she confirm that the Government have a final copper - bottomed agreement with the industry that the furnace will definitely be built on Teesside ? A number of the issues that the hon . Gentleman raises are fundamentally locally . We work closely with Mayor Ben Houchen , who has done a remarkable amount of work for his part of the country . The reality is that the steel sector was placed in an area of uncertainty for some time . We were able to provide support for Tata , which has ensured that the steelworks continue at Port Talbot .

It said that the Government ’ s plans “ are simply not sufficient for the task at hand . ” In the two years since , there is no indication that their approach has improved . Last month , when I asked the mental health Minister , the hon . Member for Lewes ( Maria Caulfield ) , in a written question what proportion of mental health funding had been allocated to children and young people , I received an answer that such funds are not “ separately identifiable . ” How can a Government begin to take a problem seriously when they do not even know how much money they are spending on it ? Sadly , in the eyes of the Treasury children and young people are too often seen as a financial burden and a drain on Government resources , and that is just wrong . Spending on education and services to support our children is an investment in their future and our country ’ s future , and it is time that the Government recognised that . The introduction of mental health support teams has been an encouraging step forward , but they are under - resourced and overstretched . Last year , I visited Carshalton Boys Sports College . I met MHST staff as well as some of the pupils they were supporting . The boys talked about how the team had helped them to learn coping techniques for anxiety and how to identify the techniques that work for them . The staff mentioned how important it was that they could intervene early before things escalate and children need other services , such as child and adolescent mental health services , but what struck me was that the team was stretched thinly across many local primary and secondary schools , which meant that their valuable skills and service were available only for half a day to one day per week in each school . Furthermore , research by the Liberal Democrats revealed that by the end of this year half of secondary schools and three quarters of all primary schools in England will still have no access at all to mental health support teams . Instead , the role of supporting children ’ s mental ill health falls on teachers , who are already managing a heavy workload at the same time as contending with extremely overstretched budgets . With many schools struggling to afford the basics , sadly some of those that have found their own money for mental health support are being forced to cut back , which is why schools must not have to fund the provision themselves . My Bill makes it clear that funding needs to be made available for the proposed statutory duty for all state schools . Using the “ polluter pays ” principle , Liberal Democrats have proposed funding mental health practitioners through tripling the digital services tax on our big social media companies , given the harm that they have contributed to our children ’ s mental health . A big challenge currently facing schools is persistent absence , with the most recent Government data revealing that a fifth of children missed on average a day of school every fortnight last term . One of the most significant causal factors of absence is mental ill health . According to new data from YoungMinds , more than one in five children waiting for mental health support has missed more than six months of school .

Last month , when I asked the mental health Minister , the hon .

Sadly , in the eyes of the Treasury children and young people are too often seen as a financial burden and a drain on Government resources , and that is just wrong . Spending on education and services to support our children is an investment in their future and our country ’ s future , and it is time that the Government recognised that . The introduction of mental health support teams has been an encouraging step forward , but they are under - resourced and overstretched . Last year , I visited Carshalton Boys Sports College . I met MHST staff as well as some of the pupils they were supporting . The boys talked about how the team had helped them to learn coping techniques for anxiety and how to identify the techniques that work for them . The staff mentioned how important it was that they could intervene early before things escalate and children need other services , such as child and adolescent mental health services , but what struck me was that the team was stretched thinly across many local primary and secondary schools , which meant that their valuable skills and service were available only for half a day to one day per week in each school . Furthermore , research by the Liberal Democrats revealed that by the end of this year half of secondary schools and three quarters of all primary schools in England will still have no access at all to mental health support teams .

Our priority is turning the commitments in the women ’ s health strategy into tangible actions , such as by setting out how we will eliminate cervical cancer by 2040 through the new cervical cancer plan . We have taken urgent action , through our elective reform plan , to support the nearly 600 , 000 women who are on gynaecology waiting lists . One in 10 women in Northern Ireland is thought to have endometriosis , and the average wait time for diagnosis is an unacceptable nine and a half years . Does the Minister agree that there needs to be a UK - wide strategy that equips our NHS with endo - experienced surgeons , fertility experts , mental health support and pain specialists in order to aid those women , who are on the most horrifically painful journey ? I thank the hon . Member for raising this issue . She is right : it is unacceptable that women can wait up to 10 years for an endometriosis diagnosis . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ’ s updated guidelines on endometriosis make firmer recommendations on referral and investigations , which will help women receive a diagnosis and effective treatment faster . It is important that we continue to work as closely we can on this issue across the whole UK . What assessment she has made of the potential impact of the Government ’ s proposed welfare reforms on financial inequalities experienced by disabled people . The hon . Member is right to raise this issue ; the current system does track too many people in financial inequality . We want disabled people to have chances in work , which others have always taken for granted . We will invest an additional £1 billion a year by the end of the decade in work , health and skills support . I have spoken to several disabled constituents who are deeply fearful about the proposed cut to the limited capability for work and work - related activity element of universal credit . Research by Sense shows that one in four disabled people with complex needs could be pushed into debt if the changes go ahead . Will the Minister and his colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions review this damaging proposal ? At the moment , there are 200 , 000 people out of work on health and disability grounds who would love to be in a job , and who say they could be in a job today if they had the support to make that possible for them . We are determined to provide them with that support . As the Minister knows , the personal independence payment is a passport benefit for carer ’ s allowance . The Government ’ s impact assessment suggests that approximately 150 , 000 family carers will lose out due to the proposed changes to the eligibility criteria for PIP . What further analysis have the Government done of the financial impacts of welfare reform on family carers ? We are consulting on the support that will be needed over the next few years for perhaps one in 10 of those currently claiming PIP . Support will be needed for those who lose their benefit , and that will include family carers who receive carer ’ s allowance at the moment . What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help tackle violence against women and girls . We are taking firm action across Government to deliver our unprecedented ambition to halve violence against women and girls in a decade . That is underpinned by a new Government strategy , which is to be published this summer .

In this period of review , we are speaking to employers , training providers and colleges to ensure that we get this right . I call Jim Shannon to show us how it is done . I thank the Minister for her response to those questions . I know that she does not have direct responsibility for Northern Ireland , but may I ask her about apprenticeships ? In defence and cyber - security — in Thales and Spirit AeroSystems — and in agrifood , opportunities should be there for young ladies as well as for young men . What is being done to ensure that there is equality of opportunity for everyone , both male and female ? The hon . Gentleman makes an important point about ensuring that people from a range of different backgrounds , including young women , see the opportunities that exist . I have had the opportunity to meet my counterparts in Northern Ireland and I look forward to working with them to ensure that , across the UK , we can drive forward on skills , growth and opportunities for all our young people . What steps she plans to take to reform children ’ s social care . Reforming children ’ s social care is critical to delivering our opportunity mission , to ensure that a child or young person ’ s background does not limit their ambition . The children ’ s wellbeing Bill will remove barriers to opportunity and deliver the manifesto commitments on children ’ s social care , so that all children have a chance to thrive in safe , loving homes . I thank the Minister for her answer . It is just over two years since I published the independent review of children ’ s social care , which was commissioned by the previous Government . The review called for a radical reset of the whole children ’ s social care system , which was urgently needed , and the previous Government took some modest steps down that track but failed to realise the potential . Since the election , a number of the children , families and care - experienced adults who were involved in the review have been in touch with me to share their hopes that we will be able to deliver on the ambition of the review . Do the Government intend to prioritise the resources that will be needed to implement the review in the upcoming spending review ? I thank my hon . Friend for the work he did on the independent review of children ’ s social care , which this Government are considering as part of our reform programme . Children ’ s social care is a key priority for this Government , evidenced by our commitment to the children ’ s wellbeing Bill announced in the King ’ s Speech in July . A full programme for delivery will be produced in order to support that commitment . We have inherited a challenging set of economic circumstances . However , we are committed to reforming children ’ s social care , and that will be brought forward , as I have already mentioned , in the children ’ s wellbeing Bill . In Norfolk , as in many other areas , we saw during the pandemic some hugely complicated issues around early years , including lack of preparation and learning difficulties , which many of our schools are dealing with . Will the Minister reassure me that , in this forthcoming Budget , real attention will be paid both to supporting that network — supporting the previous Government ’ s introduction of early years — and to integrating better the mental health support , the learning difficulty support and the social care support ? In the end , as these are children living one life , they surely need only one network of support .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-09-09.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-09-09.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2024-01-09.txt | debates2024-01-09_F22 | 2024-01-09 | UK", "debates2024-09-09.txt | debates2024-09-09_F10 | 2024-09-09 | UK", "debates2025-03-06.txt | debates2025-03-06_F13 | 2025-03-06 | UK", "debates2025-06-18.txt | debates2025-06-18_F8 | 2025-06-18 | UK", "debates2025-07-07.txt | debates2025-07-07_F4 | 2025-07-07 | UK"], "answer": "The context does not contain this information.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T17:24:49"}

Friend is also right to say that as more money goes into the NHS , there is a duty to ensure that that is matched by reform . The 10 - year health plan will set out how we will deliver an NHS by creating a reformed and modern health service to ensure that the extra investment results in faster and more convenient treatment for patients , because that is what we all want to see . Over the last 14 years , my Camborne , Redruth and Hayle constituency has seen child poverty rise . A third of secondary school children are now persistently absent from school , educational attainment is below the national average and life expectancy has actually fallen . Those were 14 years of abject failure , for which my constituents will never forgive the Conservative party . Does the Minister agree that the true test of success of our plan for change and a decade of renewal should be measured in the positive changes to the lives of our poorest communities ? My hon . Friend puts it well . The missions that we have set out are focused on delivering long - term and ambitious outcomes that will make a meaningful difference to people ’ s lives . Specifically on the issue he raised on child poverty and the best start in life , the plan for change has a specific target to close the development gap between children who are starting school , and to ensure that more children are ready to start school and to learn and to give them the opportunities that education can bring . Our aim is that people from all backgrounds can benefit from those policies , and that is why the plan for change will make a real difference to people ’ s lives in all parts of the country . Whether the Cabinet Secretary has issued guidance on ministerial appointments . The Cabinet Secretary may be asked by the Prime Minister to advise on any matter supporting the smooth running of government , including ministerial appointments . There is no written or published guidance on such matters . Since July , three Ministers have had to resign for everything from fraud through to unwise entanglements in foreign affairs . What steps will the Minister take to strengthen the ministerial code so that the public can have confidence in the Ministers that this Prime Minister appoints ? We have strengthened the ministerial code , but we do not need to take any advice from the Conservatives . What we have seen from this Prime Minister is decisive action to uphold ministerial standards .

I understand the concerns raised by my hon . Friend ’ s constituents about the impact of the proposals . They are important changes , which is why we will consult on the proposals and lay out more details later in the year , including on any transitional arrangements . We understand the importance of clarity and fairness for those already contributing to public services , and we will provide further details in due course . The Minister talks about concerns raised by the constituents of the hon . Member for Truro and Falmouth ( Jayne Kirkham ) . They are concerns created by this Government not valuing people from different parts of the world who serve in our national health service and social care system in Cumbria and elsewhere . Will the Minister be much clearer that this proposal will not be retrospective for people who underpin our health service in Cumbria and across the country ? Will she be mindful of the impact on our health service if she goes ahead with a decision — which , at the moment , it looks like the Government are going to — that will hugely undermine the flow of workers who come here to support us and keep us all well ? May I gently disagree with the hon . Gentleman ? We do recognise the vital contribution of overseas NHS workers , and we have not yet defined what contributions will reduce the period for settlement , but the proposed changes are subject to consultation . In addition , we are committed to ensuring that the NHS remains supported , while reducing long - term reliance on migration . What recent discussions she has had with the Secretary of State for Housing , Communities and Local Government on protecting domestic abuse victims from the perpetrators of that abuse with whom they share a joint tenancy . The Renters ’ Rights Bill will allow individuals to end joint tenancies , supporting domestic abuse victims to leave their abuser if they share a home . The Ministry of Housing , Communities and Local Government has announced a £30 million increase to the domestic abuse safe accommodation grant , raising the total funding in 2025 - 26 to £160 million . My constituent Molly is trapped in the house where she was violently attacked in front of her children . She is confined to living upstairs , because going into the room downstairs triggers her post - traumatic stress disorder . Despite the perpetrator of this abuse rightfully being in prison and having a restraining order of five years , Molly ’ s landlord has told her that they cannot take him off the lease , so she cannot move . Can the Minister confirm that the Government are taking steps to ensure that victims of domestic abuse , like Molly , can move on with their lives ? I thank my hon . Friend for raising Molly ’ s case — our hearts go out to her and her children for the trauma they are living with . Her case raises many issues , including the need for early intervention in domestic abuse cases , the need to improve therapeutic support for victims and , as my hon . Friend has said , the desperate need for reform of the rules around property rights in cases of economic and domestic abuse , so that women are not trapped .

Our priority is turning the commitments in the women ’ s health strategy into tangible actions , such as by setting out how we will eliminate cervical cancer by 2040 through the new cervical cancer plan . We have taken urgent action , through our elective reform plan , to support the nearly 600 , 000 women who are on gynaecology waiting lists . One in 10 women in Northern Ireland is thought to have endometriosis , and the average wait time for diagnosis is an unacceptable nine and a half years . Does the Minister agree that there needs to be a UK - wide strategy that equips our NHS with endo - experienced surgeons , fertility experts , mental health support and pain specialists in order to aid those women , who are on the most horrifically painful journey ? I thank the hon . Member for raising this issue . She is right : it is unacceptable that women can wait up to 10 years for an endometriosis diagnosis . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ’ s updated guidelines on endometriosis make firmer recommendations on referral and investigations , which will help women receive a diagnosis and effective treatment faster . It is important that we continue to work as closely we can on this issue across the whole UK . What assessment she has made of the potential impact of the Government ’ s proposed welfare reforms on financial inequalities experienced by disabled people . The hon . Member is right to raise this issue ; the current system does track too many people in financial inequality . We want disabled people to have chances in work , which others have always taken for granted . We will invest an additional £1 billion a year by the end of the decade in work , health and skills support . I have spoken to several disabled constituents who are deeply fearful about the proposed cut to the limited capability for work and work - related activity element of universal credit . Research by Sense shows that one in four disabled people with complex needs could be pushed into debt if the changes go ahead . Will the Minister and his colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions review this damaging proposal ? At the moment , there are 200 , 000 people out of work on health and disability grounds who would love to be in a job , and who say they could be in a job today if they had the support to make that possible for them . We are determined to provide them with that support . As the Minister knows , the personal independence payment is a passport benefit for carer ’ s allowance . The Government ’ s impact assessment suggests that approximately 150 , 000 family carers will lose out due to the proposed changes to the eligibility criteria for PIP . What further analysis have the Government done of the financial impacts of welfare reform on family carers ? We are consulting on the support that will be needed over the next few years for perhaps one in 10 of those currently claiming PIP . Support will be needed for those who lose their benefit , and that will include family carers who receive carer ’ s allowance at the moment . What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help tackle violence against women and girls . We are taking firm action across Government to deliver our unprecedented ambition to halve violence against women and girls in a decade . That is underpinned by a new Government strategy , which is to be published this summer . Last year , we launched new domestic abuse protection orders and set out new measures to tackle stalking .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-06-18.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-06-18.txt"}, {"score": 38.16390406716497, "chunk_id": "debates2024-09-09_F10", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-09-09.txt", "date": "2024-09-09", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Friend . In this period of review , we are speaking to employers , training providers and colleges to ensure that we get this right . I call Jim Shannon to show us how it is done . I thank the Minister for her response to those questions . I know that she does not have direct responsibility for Northern Ireland , but may I ask her about apprenticeships ? In defence and cyber - security — in Thales and Spirit AeroSystems — and in agrifood , opportunities should be there for young ladies as well as for young men . What is being done to ensure that there is equality of opportunity for everyone , both male and female ? The hon . Gentleman makes an important point about ensuring that people from a range of different backgrounds , including young women , see the opportunities that exist . I have had the opportunity to meet my counterparts in Northern Ireland and I look forward to working with them to ensure that , across the UK , we can drive forward on skills , growth and opportunities for all our young people . What steps she plans to take to reform children ’ s social care . Reforming children ’ s social care is critical to delivering our opportunity mission , to ensure that a child or young person ’ s background does not limit their ambition . The children ’ s wellbeing Bill will remove barriers to opportunity and deliver the manifesto commitments on children ’ s social care , so that all children have a chance to thrive in safe , loving homes . I thank the Minister for her answer . It is just over two years since I published the independent review of children ’ s social care , which was commissioned by the previous Government . The review called for a radical reset of the whole children ’ s social care system , which was urgently needed , and the previous Government took some modest steps down that track but failed to realise the potential . Since the election , a number of the children , families and care - experienced adults who were involved in the review have been in touch with me to share their hopes that we will be able to deliver on the ambition of the review . Do the Government intend to prioritise the resources that will be needed to implement the review in the upcoming spending review ? I thank my hon . Friend for the work he did on the independent review of children ’ s social care , which this Government are considering as part of our reform programme . Children ’ s social care is a key priority for this Government , evidenced by our commitment to the children ’ s wellbeing Bill announced in the King ’ s Speech in July . A full programme for delivery will be produced in order to support that commitment . We have inherited a challenging set of economic circumstances . However , we are committed to reforming children ’ s social care , and that will be brought forward , as I have already mentioned , in the children ’ s wellbeing Bill . In Norfolk , as in many other areas , we saw during the pandemic some hugely complicated issues around early years , including lack of preparation and learning difficulties , which many of our schools are dealing with . Will the Minister reassure me that , in this forthcoming Budget , real attention will be paid both to supporting that network — supporting the previous Government ’ s introduction of early years — and to integrating better the mental health support , the learning difficulty support and the social care support ? In the end , as these are children living one life , they surely need only one network of support .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-09-09.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-09-09.txt"}, {"score": 37.949447989505806, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-19_F10", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-19.txt", "date": "2024-11-19", "parliament": "UK", "text": "I will be very happy to raise the role that Ministers can play in improving mental health and wellbeing in my bilaterals with the Ministry of Housing , Communities and Local Government . What estimate he has made of the number of new dental training places needed in the east of England . Fourteen years of Conservative neglect and incompetence have left huge swathes of the east of England as dental deserts . As part of our 10 - year plan , we will be working with NHS England to assess the need for more dental trainees in areas such as the east of England where we know that many people are struggling to find an NHS dentist . I am aware of the University of East Anglia ’ s plans to open a dental school and I recently met MPs from the east of England , including the hon . Gentleman , to discuss that process . I encourage the UEA to continue with its bid for a new dental school . The Minister well knows that there is a lack of dentists in the east of England , because there is no undergraduate training facility . The nearest place is either Birmingham or London . He has kindly mentioned the University of East Anglia , which is ready to go with a new building under construction . It has wide cross - party support , as he also knows from the meeting that he held recently , so when will he make the announcement ? I thank the hon . Gentleman for that follow - up question , but he will recall that , when we met , I and my officials made it clear to him that the UEA has not yet submitted its bid for a dental school . In that meeting , we said : “ Please go back to the UEA and encourage them to submit that bid . When they do , we will look at it very carefully . ” Many of my constituents in Bedford are struggling to get an NHS dentist . I am also hearing from those who have tried to book an appointment only to discover that they have been removed from the NHS list without any warning . The Government have committed to improve the dental contract . In doing so , will they ensure that dentists can no longer drop people from their books — leaving them without any access to care — without prior notice ? My hon . Friend is right : we will reform the dental contract to rebuild dentistry in the long term and to increase access to NHS dental care , with a shift to focusing on prevention and the retention of NHS dentists . We continue to meet representatives from the British Dental Association and other representatives of the sector to discuss how we can best deliver our shared ambition to improve access for NHS dental patients . What recent assessment he has made of the potential impact of proposed changes to employer national insurance contributions on staffing costs for health and care providers . The leadership shown by the Chancellor has enabled her and the Government to fix the foundations of the public finances and fill the £22 billion black hole left by the previous Government . The decisions that she took meant that she was able to provide this Department with an extra £26 billion and a real - terms increase in core local government spending power by about 3 . 2 % . That was the right decision for the right reasons in the national interest , and I am taking into consideration pressures on all parts of health and social care before making final allocations for the year ahead .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-11-19.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-11-19.txt"}, {"score": 37.588302832805475, "chunk_id": "debates2025-07-07_F3", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-07-07.txt", "date": "2025-07-07", "parliament": "UK", "text": "With both police and health realigning into neighbourhood teams , will the Home Secretary ensure that there is reach across the services , with a named lead police officer , to develop prevention and early intervention strategies , diverting those at risk through harm reduction approaches , including treatment and support ? With the recently launched 10 - year health plan , we are moving away from those siloed services towards a more joined - up approach , including the preventive model of care . That aligns very much with policing and keeping people safe , and supporting wellbeing . I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the national neighbourhood health implementation programme and to ensure that policing is part of the conversation from the outset . By working more closely with health and care partners , we can reduce inappropriate demand on policing . Officers should not be left to pick up the pieces when other support services are better placed to help . This is about getting it right — and getting that tailored support — first time . I thank the Policing Minister for visiting Northallerton this year and hearing directly from my farming constituents about the impact of livestock and equipment crime on their lives and health . I am grateful to North Yorkshire police for all their hard work , and for the recent funding uplift for the national rural crime unit , but does the Minister agree with me on the importance of implementing the Equipment Theft ( Prevention ) Act 2023 and , more broadly , ensuring that rural areas get the attention they deserve ? It was a pleasure to meet the right hon . Gentleman ’ s constituents ; I think that was way back in February — it was a very cold day in North Yorkshire . I fully recognise what he says about the mental health and wellbeing impact of some of the crime challenges facing rural communities . That is why the neighbourhood policing guarantee is so important for areas like the one that he represents . As I have said a number of times in this House , we support the implementation of the Equipment Theft ( Prevention ) Act , and we plan to bring forward regulations shortly . What discussions she has had with Cabinet colleagues on the potential impact of the proposed increase to the standard qualifying period for settlement on NHS staffing levels . This Government recognise and value the contribution that NHS staff make to our country . That is why , under the settlement proposals in the immigration White Paper , we have made it clear that individuals will be able to reduce the standard 10 - year period based on their contributions to the UK ’ s economy and society . We will consult on detailed proposals later this year . These are important changes : we recognise how important this matter is , and we will listen to what people tell us in that consultation . An impact assessment will be developed alongside any finalised policy . I have been contacted by constituents working in health and social care in Truro and Falmouth who are concerned about the proposed changes to the standard qualifying period . Dr Mohamed Abdelazim works as a doctor at the Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS trust and has not quite completed the five - year eligibility period . He says the policy will directly and severely impact him and hundreds of other frontline workers and that 10 years is a very long time to live on a visa without the security that citizenship would provide .

She has left behind a strong legacy through her purposeful mentorship and healthcare advocacy . As president and CEO , Sue led 19 medical practices that provide care for more than 26 , 000 patients combined . Her colleagues , patients , and partners in the healthcare space admired her innovative goals for community health centers . She is said to have inspired those around her to aim higher and make a difference . Sue was a dedicated board member of the National Association of Community Health Centers and the South Carolina Primary Health Care Association . She championed local , state , and national priorities in the health center movement and will be remembered as a committed visionary . In her national work , she was a founding member of a lobbying group called 340B Working Table , which represents hospitals , drugmakers , and various health interests that work together to advance bipartisan 340B legislation . She testified before Congress several times to advocate for 340B progiams and affected patients . Prior to her career in community health , Sue faced a life - threatening tragedy . A devastating dam failure caused extensive damage and heavy flooding in her town . This disastrous incident took the life of her young daughter . According to Sue , the kindness demonstrated by the healthcare professionals who treated her injuries and helped her move forward proved to be an inspiration . Her survival story , and the healthcare professionals at the forefront , led her to pursue a career in community health and sympathize with patients every step of the way . Her compassionate ` ` Monday Messages & # x27 ; & # x27 ; of encouragement to colleagues and friends will be cherished and fondly missed . She is said to have cultivated many deep connections , and I pray for her family , friends , and loved ones as we all mourn her loss . Mr .

Children being able to play is something we take for granted , yet Ministers will know from their travels that it is not something that all children around the world get to do . Play instils confidence , builds life skills , enhances resilience and restores hope , so will a Minister commit to the House that they will take a lead role in the forthcoming UN General Assembly to support the resolution for an international day of play , which is spearheaded by a coalition of organisations such as Lego and IKEA , to ensure that every child ’ s right to play is protected ? The idea of an international day of play is very important , and we take it seriously . I will pick the matter up with the noble Lord Ahmad and keep in touch with my hon . Friend . In the past decade , more than 1 . 7 billion people have been affected by climate disasters through displacement , drought and food insecurity . The climate crisis is both creating and aggravating humanitarian emergencies . Where is the ambitious strategy for UK aid to build resilience and offset the implications of climate breakdown ? The hon . Lady is right to identify climate change as the great existential crisis of this era . Two weeks ago we had the hottest temperature seen in the world ever on the Monday ; it was then exceeded on Wednesday and exceeded again on Thursday . One way we have changed how humanitarian work is done is by building in more adaptation and resilience when we deploy humanitarian support , and we will go on doing that . Evidence suggests that malaria is on the move ; it has appeared in parts of the US and is creeping across Europe . Can the Foreign Office please confirm that it is serious about eradicating malaria and neglected tropical diseases across the world , and say what plans are being taken , if any , to keep British people safe ? My hon . Friend is entirely right . I was recently in Mozambique , where they had managed to cut malaria infection by 50 % , but we saw that climate change is now leading to its increasing again . We will do everything we can to make sure that what had previously been a successful policy of malaria eradication gets back on track as soon as possible . A loophole in the sanctions regime has seen Russian steel processed in Turkey and exported to the UK . The 43 % increase in Russian steel exports to Turkey in the last year alone shows the extent of the problem . The Government have belatedly introduced a ban on imports of such steel , but without enforcement the ban will be meaningless . Can the Minister tell the House what the Government ’ s plans are to enforce the ban on imports of Russian steel processed in Turkey ? As I have said , we continue to work on our sanctions policy to ensure that we get to grips with any potential circumventions , but it would not be appropriate for me to announce any future plans yet . Whether it is the accession to the trans - Pacific partnership , the first free trade agreement with Malaysia and Brunei , our Foreign Secretary at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit or the joint economic trade committee with Indonesia on Thursday , the Government are rightly doing all they can to bring alive the benefits of our trans - Pacific and Indo - Pacific pivot .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-07-18.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-07-18.txt"}, {"score": 38.951853308486385, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-26_F28", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-26.txt", "date": "2024-11-26", "parliament": "UK", "text": "It also says that it can lead to lower electricity , which she constantly denies .

I call the Chair of the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee . May I gently say to the shadow Secretary of State that she really should not believe dodgy headlines in The Daily Telegraph ? In fact , I am not sure whether headlines in The Daily Telegraph are ever not dodgy , based on what she was quoting . More importantly , though , let me congratulate the Prime Minister on his leadership at the conference of the parties , and the Secretary of State on leading the negotiations , and not least on delivering the £300 billion of climate finance for developing countries . He set out this country ’ s achievement since the general election ; to what extent will the combination of what this country showed at COP and what we have delivered at home since 4 July encourage countries around the world to play their part in addressing the climate crisis ? My hon . Friend asks an important question . Two truths came out of COP : first , the transition is unstoppable and , secondly , it is not going fast enough . There is such a difference from a decade ago — my hon . Friend , who was there with me , is nodding in agreement — because every country knows that the climate crisis is happening and is affecting them . The testimony I heard was like the testimony that we could provide about what people are seeing . Every country knows they have to act , and while they all face constraints in acting , they also know — this is the big change from a decade ago — that it is massively in their economic interests . There is a race on for the good jobs of the future , and the clean energy transition can provide them . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . COP29 concluded with a deal that , while welcome , leaves much to be desired . I must stress that we need bolder , more decisive action if we are to face the greatest challenge of our time : the climate crisis . I know that the right hon . Gentleman ’ s heart is in the right place and has been for many years . We first met in the run - up to COP15 in 2009 , and I express my thanks to him for his staunch leadership in the intervening years . I express Lib Dem support for a brave programme of action going forward and our willingness to work with his Department to help the UK step up and seize this opportunity for climate leadership . While we welcome the Prime Minister ’ s commitment to ambitious emissions targets for 2035 , commitments alone are not enough . Immediate action is needed to insulate homes , reduce energy costs and ensure that no one has to choose between heating and eating . The delay to Labour ’ s warm homes plan until spring 2025 is unacceptable when millions of people , including 1 . 2 million pensioners , face a cold and unaffordable winter due to the cut in the winter fuel allowance .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-11-26.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-11-26.txt"}, {"score": 38.6422214792249, "chunk_id": "debates2025-01-17_F22", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-01-17.txt", "date": "2025-01-17", "parliament": "UK", "text": "That is why , in the election , we committed to tripling solar power by 2030 .

I note that this Government , in just one week , has consented to more solar than the last Government installed in an entire year . That shows the marked difference this Government are already making in an area that the whole House is clearly passionate about . I am pleased that the Minister is developing strong new standards , which will combine Labour ’ s ambition to build high - quality homes in the right places and the ambition to protect our environment . Our commitment to action will bring lower bills to my constituents . That is sorely needed after a difficult cost of living crisis , lasting for years , which has put pressure on household bills . In this way , we can really support our constituents . Through our meaningful action on more sustainable renewable sources of energy , we are making a difference to our climate . It is pretty clear that the climate crisis does not respect rhetoric , weapons or borders ; it does not care how many likes you get on social media or how viral your clip goes ; it responds only to action , and the action the Government are taking gives me hope for the future . Across my constituency , people are taking action , and doing their bit to shift us toward cleaner energy . We must meet their ambition for a greener , sunnier and more secure future . I thank my hon . Friend the Member for Cheltenham ( Max Wilkinson ) for bringing the Bill before the House . As an environmental campaigner for the past 22 years , I very much support any Bill , including my own Climate and Nature Bill — a shameless plug — that encourages the shift away from fossil fuels . However , I do not support every measure that increases the use of renewables , which is why the sunshine Bill is so important .

That is my concern about some of the very large solar installations we are seeing proposed across the country , including in my constituency of South Cotswolds .

There seems to be a shift in focus, with some emphasizing the economic opportunities and role of clean energy as part of the solution, while others highlight the urgency and existential nature of the climate crisis.\n\nIn [Doc 1], the British Government takes an optimistic stance on the benefits of play for children's development and suggests taking a lead role in a resolution for an international day of play to protect every child’s right to play. This indicates an emphasis on the economic and social opportunities presented by addressing climate change and ensuring access to basic resources like play.\n\nIn contrast, [Doc 2] from [Doc 2] emphasizes the urgency of climate action as a global challenge that is affecting all countries equally due to climate change impacts. The Prime Minister's leadership at COP shows that there has been progress in recognizing this crisis but also acknowledges that more decisive and immediate actions are needed. This document highlights how climate change can impact energy security, economic interests, and the transition towards clean energy.\n\n[Doc 3] from [Doc 3] discusses a commitment to tripling solar power by 2030, framing it within the context of making Britain a \"clean energy superpower.\" The Minister supports this with actions such as approving solar projects that will support over 400,000 homes. This speaks more towards the economic opportunity in transitioning to clean energy sources.\n\nTherefore, while [Doc 1] focuses on play and its benefits, and [Doc 2] highlights the global nature of climate impacts affecting all countries equally, [Doc 3] leans towards presenting solar power as an investment with economic potential for Britain.

A key part is more traditional forms of power production . For instance , all the cardboard that is not used in those factories and that cannot be recycled is turned into electricity , and carbon capture is used . The carbon capture process is then used to support work in other factories , such as the production of plasterboard , and the waste heat is used . The factories are already doing great work , and they want to expand further with solar power , particularly on an old landfill site , which is perfectly placed . That is a great opportunity , but there are also the factory roofs . Not all the buildings are suitable , but as we build on that cluster and can generate power locally , and as we build more homes around them and in that area to provide power , solar power has an important part to play . I very much want to see that we are able to change our building regulations and to ensure they meet the needs and opportunities from factories , but , at the same time , we must not close our eyes to the fact that there are many other ways of ensuring that we reach a zero - carbon future . Fixing the housing crisis is absolutely not mutually exclusive with fixing the climate crisis . The hon . Member rightly identified the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis . I would add in the housing crisis as a third part of that , and I can see he does not disagree . This point has been made a few times , but it is almost as if there is a tension between protecting our natural environment and making progress on renewable energy sources . It is not a choice between the two ; one is central to the other . As a former councillor , I know that it is vital that community voices are heard in this . If there is one thing that upsets local communities , it is when they are not involved in conversations on matters that directly impact them and the areas they live in . Does my hon . Friend agree ? I wholeheartedly agree . I gave the example of a power generator on a roof not working , and that came down to the fact that the local community was not involved . The residents on the block saw no benefit from it , but it was causing them problems , including leaks in the roof and all sorts of other stuff . It is vital that we have not just a circular energy economy but a circular economic and monetary economy so that people see the benefits in their pockets as well as in the lights and heating in their homes . I am keen to hear from the Minister what the Government plan to do to change the building regulations , meet the aspirations in the Bill and ensure that we have a comprehensive strategy to progress towards a zero - carbon , net zero future , while ensuring that that does not get in the way of tackling local environmental problems — biodiversity and so on — or the housing and cost of living crises . Those things are all joined up . That is how developers will work and deliver , and how we can ensure that that happens . We all know that implementation is the tricky part of policy . The intention is very straightforward — and this Bill is full of great intentions — but getting the implementation right will be the challenge .

For instance, during the 2024-11-26 debate (Doc 2), the Conservative party's shadow Secretary of State mentions the \"great existential crisis\" caused by climate change but also acknowledges the economic interests countries have in transitioning to clean energy. The Liberal Democrats in the same debate highlight both the ambitious strategy for climate finance and the need for immediate action to insulate homes, reduce energy costs, and support vulnerable groups during winter.\n\nIn contrast, speakers like Dr Savage (Doc 5) emphasize a more existential crisis perspective, describing climate change as an \"existential threat\" with direct personal impact, such as the risk of Kiribati disappearing beneath waves. She connects this to the Bill's purpose of protecting threatened species and ensuring a future for nature.\n\nTom Bradshaw from National Farmers' Union in Doc 3 suggests that solar farms can offer diversification opportunities for farmers, hinting at economic benefits within their context. However, Dr Savage (Doc 5) criticizes large-scale solar installations as less good ways to meet carbon emissions commitments because they often disregard the needs and cooperation of local communities.\n\nIn summary, while speakers from different parties have various emphases—some more focused on the economic opportunities for sectors like agriculture and energy production, others highlight existential threats—the core issue is seen through both lenses.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T17:28:56"}

We make very strong representations , our high commission there works closely with affected groups , and we always keep travel advice under sharp and close review . Children being able to play is something we take for granted , yet Ministers will know from their travels that it is not something that all children around the world get to do . Play instils confidence , builds life skills , enhances resilience and restores hope , so will a Minister commit to the House that they will take a lead role in the forthcoming UN General Assembly to support the resolution for an international day of play , which is spearheaded by a coalition of organisations such as Lego and IKEA , to ensure that every child ’ s right to play is protected ? The idea of an international day of play is very important , and we take it seriously . I will pick the matter up with the noble Lord Ahmad and keep in touch with my hon . Friend . In the past decade , more than 1 . 7 billion people have been affected by climate disasters through displacement , drought and food insecurity . The climate crisis is both creating and aggravating humanitarian emergencies . Where is the ambitious strategy for UK aid to build resilience and offset the implications of climate breakdown ? The hon . Lady is right to identify climate change as the great existential crisis of this era . Two weeks ago we had the hottest temperature seen in the world ever on the Monday ; it was then exceeded on Wednesday and exceeded again on Thursday . One way we have changed how humanitarian work is done is by building in more adaptation and resilience when we deploy humanitarian support , and we will go on doing that . Evidence suggests that malaria is on the move ; it has appeared in parts of the US and is creeping across Europe . Can the Foreign Office please confirm that it is serious about eradicating malaria and neglected tropical diseases across the world , and say what plans are being taken , if any , to keep British people safe ? My hon . Friend is entirely right . I was recently in Mozambique , where they had managed to cut malaria infection by 50 % , but we saw that climate change is now leading to its increasing again . We will do everything we can to make sure that what had previously been a successful policy of malaria eradication gets back on track as soon as possible . A loophole in the sanctions regime has seen Russian steel processed in Turkey and exported to the UK . The 43 % increase in Russian steel exports to Turkey in the last year alone shows the extent of the problem . The Government have belatedly introduced a ban on imports of such steel , but without enforcement the ban will be meaningless . Can the Minister tell the House what the Government ’ s plans are to enforce the ban on imports of Russian steel processed in Turkey ? As I have said , we continue to work on our sanctions policy to ensure that we get to grips with any potential circumventions , but it would not be appropriate for me to announce any future plans yet . Whether it is the accession to the trans - Pacific partnership , the first free trade agreement with Malaysia and Brunei , our Foreign Secretary at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit or the joint economic trade committee with Indonesia on Thursday , the Government are rightly doing all they can to bring alive the benefits of our trans - Pacific and Indo - Pacific pivot .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-07-18.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-07-18.txt"}, {"score": 38.951853308486385, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-26_F28", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-26.txt", "date": "2024-11-26", "parliament": "UK", "text": "It also says that it can lead to lower electricity , which she constantly denies . The truth about the right hon . Lady is that she has nothing to say . The Conservative party is basically saying , “ Stop the world — we want to get off . ” That will do nothing for the British people . She has a lot to learn . I am afraid to say that she needs to start reflecting on where her Government went wrong . They went wrong in many different ways , and she does not seem to be learning any lessons . I call the Chair of the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee . May I gently say to the shadow Secretary of State that she really should not believe dodgy headlines in The Daily Telegraph ? In fact , I am not sure whether headlines in The Daily Telegraph are ever not dodgy , based on what she was quoting . More importantly , though , let me congratulate the Prime Minister on his leadership at the conference of the parties , and the Secretary of State on leading the negotiations , and not least on delivering the £300 billion of climate finance for developing countries . He set out this country ’ s achievement since the general election ; to what extent will the combination of what this country showed at COP and what we have delivered at home since 4 July encourage countries around the world to play their part in addressing the climate crisis ? My hon . Friend asks an important question . Two truths came out of COP : first , the transition is unstoppable and , secondly , it is not going fast enough . There is such a difference from a decade ago — my hon . Friend , who was there with me , is nodding in agreement — because every country knows that the climate crisis is happening and is affecting them . The testimony I heard was like the testimony that we could provide about what people are seeing . Every country knows they have to act , and while they all face constraints in acting , they also know — this is the big change from a decade ago — that it is massively in their economic interests . There is a race on for the good jobs of the future , and the clean energy transition can provide them . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . COP29 concluded with a deal that , while welcome , leaves much to be desired . I must stress that we need bolder , more decisive action if we are to face the greatest challenge of our time : the climate crisis . I know that the right hon . Gentleman ’ s heart is in the right place and has been for many years . We first met in the run - up to COP15 in 2009 , and I express my thanks to him for his staunch leadership in the intervening years . I express Lib Dem support for a brave programme of action going forward and our willingness to work with his Department to help the UK step up and seize this opportunity for climate leadership . While we welcome the Prime Minister ’ s commitment to ambitious emissions targets for 2035 , commitments alone are not enough . Immediate action is needed to insulate homes , reduce energy costs and ensure that no one has to choose between heating and eating . The delay to Labour ’ s warm homes plan until spring 2025 is unacceptable when millions of people , including 1 . 2 million pensioners , face a cold and unaffordable winter due to the cut in the winter fuel allowance .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-11-26.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-11-26.txt"}, {"score": 38.6422214792249, "chunk_id": "debates2025-01-17_F22", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-01-17.txt", "date": "2025-01-17", "parliament": "UK", "text": "That is why , in the election , we committed to tripling solar power by 2030 . Solar energy has an important role , and it is a part of GB Energy , which supports our mission to make our country a clean energy superpower . We are meeting our pledges with action : we are approving solar projects that will power the equivalent of almost 400 , 000 homes . I note that this Government , in just one week , has consented to more solar than the last Government installed in an entire year . That shows the marked difference this Government are already making in an area that the whole House is clearly passionate about . I am pleased that the Minister is developing strong new standards , which will combine Labour ’ s ambition to build high - quality homes in the right places and the ambition to protect our environment . Our commitment to action will bring lower bills to my constituents . That is sorely needed after a difficult cost of living crisis , lasting for years , which has put pressure on household bills . In this way , we can really support our constituents . Through our meaningful action on more sustainable renewable sources of energy , we are making a difference to our climate . It is pretty clear that the climate crisis does not respect rhetoric , weapons or borders ; it does not care how many likes you get on social media or how viral your clip goes ; it responds only to action , and the action the Government are taking gives me hope for the future . Across my constituency , people are taking action , and doing their bit to shift us toward cleaner energy . We must meet their ambition for a greener , sunnier and more secure future . I thank my hon . Friend the Member for Cheltenham ( Max Wilkinson ) for bringing the Bill before the House . As an environmental campaigner for the past 22 years , I very much support any Bill , including my own Climate and Nature Bill — a shameless plug — that encourages the shift away from fossil fuels . However , I do not support every measure that increases the use of renewables , which is why the sunshine Bill is so important . There are good ways and less good ways to meet our international commitments on carbon emissions and climate change . A less good way , as has already been mentioned by many hon . Members , is to cover large tracts of our countryside in solar panels without the agreement or co - operation of local communities . I welcome the Bill , but the choice between solar farms and rooftop solar installations is not a zero - sum game ; they both have a distinct role to play . In our most ambitious plans , solar farms would account for less than 1 % of land cover . Does the hon . Lady agree with Tom Bradshaw , president of the National Farmers ’ Union , that solar farms represent a diversification opportunity for farmers that will also be good for the British public ? I thank the hon . Member for the good points she raises , but I would like to see more solar panel installations that are motivated not by profit , but by concern for people and planet . That is my concern about some of the very large solar installations we are seeing proposed across the country , including in my constituency of South Cotswolds . We are rightly proud of our beautiful countryside , so a proposal for a 2 , 000 - acre solar farm has provoked outrage and objections from nearby communities . Some 88 % of respondents to an early consultation are against the plans .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-01-17.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-01-17.txt"}, {"score": 38.48032209327805, "chunk_id": "debates2025-01-17_F8", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-01-17.txt", "date": "2025-01-17", "parliament": "UK", "text": "It is part of a set of factories that use their waste products and heat to generate power themselves in a circular carbon economy . A key part is more traditional forms of power production . For instance , all the cardboard that is not used in those factories and that cannot be recycled is turned into electricity , and carbon capture is used . The carbon capture process is then used to support work in other factories , such as the production of plasterboard , and the waste heat is used . The factories are already doing great work , and they want to expand further with solar power , particularly on an old landfill site , which is perfectly placed . That is a great opportunity , but there are also the factory roofs . Not all the buildings are suitable , but as we build on that cluster and can generate power locally , and as we build more homes around them and in that area to provide power , solar power has an important part to play . I very much want to see that we are able to change our building regulations and to ensure they meet the needs and opportunities from factories , but , at the same time , we must not close our eyes to the fact that there are many other ways of ensuring that we reach a zero - carbon future . Fixing the housing crisis is absolutely not mutually exclusive with fixing the climate crisis . The hon . Member rightly identified the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis . I would add in the housing crisis as a third part of that , and I can see he does not disagree . This point has been made a few times , but it is almost as if there is a tension between protecting our natural environment and making progress on renewable energy sources . It is not a choice between the two ; one is central to the other . As a former councillor , I know that it is vital that community voices are heard in this . If there is one thing that upsets local communities , it is when they are not involved in conversations on matters that directly impact them and the areas they live in . Does my hon . Friend agree ? I wholeheartedly agree . I gave the example of a power generator on a roof not working , and that came down to the fact that the local community was not involved . The residents on the block saw no benefit from it , but it was causing them problems , including leaks in the roof and all sorts of other stuff . It is vital that we have not just a circular energy economy but a circular economic and monetary economy so that people see the benefits in their pockets as well as in the lights and heating in their homes . I am keen to hear from the Minister what the Government plan to do to change the building regulations , meet the aspirations in the Bill and ensure that we have a comprehensive strategy to progress towards a zero - carbon , net zero future , while ensuring that that does not get in the way of tackling local environmental problems — biodiversity and so on — or the housing and cost of living crises . Those things are all joined up . That is how developers will work and deliver , and how we can ensure that that happens . We all know that implementation is the tricky part of policy . The intention is very straightforward — and this Bill is full of great intentions — but getting the implementation right will be the challenge .

Second Reading I beg to move , That the Bill be now read a Second time . The Climate and Nature Bill has been four years in the making . The enormous amount of support that it has garnered from campaigners , trade unions , scientists , faith leaders , non - governmental organisations , businesses and especially young people means that it is both an honour and an enormous responsibility to set out what it entails , what it adds to existing law and why I believe it addresses the most important existential challenge of our generation : the intertwined climate and nature crises . This country has signed up to various international commitments , but we still have work to do to fully connect them to real and measurable action . We need to close the ambition gap between what is needed and what is promised , and the delivery gap between what is promised and what is actually happening . That is what the Bill aims to do , because too many metrics are still heading in the wrong direction . It is important , as the hon . Lady has underlined , that we move forward together . She has not mentioned the National Farmers Union . Can she reassure me and others in the House that the National Farmers Union , and the Ulster Farmers Union in Northern Ireland , are happy with the Bill and accept the impact that its proposals will have on them ? I thank the hon . Gentleman for his intervention . I would be delighted to have that conversation with representatives of the NFU in Northern Ireland and to reassure them on that point . As an environmental campaigner for the past 22 years , it has sometimes been easy for me to fall into doomism . Wild fires have ravaged Los Angeles , floods have devastated Valencia and the recently elected leader of the free world is urging us to “ drill , baby , drill ” in the name of making America great again , but I do not believe that doomism is helpful . Yes , the best time to take bold action on climate and nature would have been 50 years ago , but the second best time is now .

It is not trying to be over - ambitious or pretending to be a silver bullet , but it aspires to answer the question : from where we are now , what is the right next step to take ? The Bill ’ s guiding principle is that we have a duty to be good ancestors . Now that we know what we know about the impact that human activity is having on the liveability of our planet , how do we strike the right balance between present and future thriving ? How do we ensure that we are not stealing health , wealth and wellbeing from generations not yet born ? While we enrich our lives , how do we ensure we do not impoverish future lives ?

In the 35 years before privatisation almost 100 reservoirs were built ; in the 35 years since privatisation , not one major English reservoir has been built . But it gets worse , because in that same period private water companies have sold off 25 reservoirs without replacing one . Instead of investing in resilience , they have extracted value : £72 billion paid out in dividends while pipes leak , rivers choke , and the public pays the price . My hon . Friend the Member for Bury North ( Mr Frith ) asks how we can afford it ; how can we not afford it ? That is not mismanagement ; it is a betrayal . If scientists tell us the climate crisis is an existential threat to humanity and to this country — Will my hon . Friend give way ? One second . If scientists tell us the climate crisis is an existential threat to humanity and to this country , we must treat it as such : an existential conflict . In that context , the actions of these companies — selling off reservoirs , failing to invest , polluting our water — are not just negligent ; they are acts that actively undermine our national water security . In any other existential crisis , we might call that what it is : sabotage . And in a time of national peril , sabotage has another name : treason . Let me explain why this matters to me personally . When I served on tour in Afghanistan back in 2009 — not in a boy band — I experienced something utterly alien to me : the gnawing fear of thirst ; not the mild irritation of forgetting a water bottle , but the deep physical worry that there may not be enough clean water to get through the day . In Britain , we have been blessed : water falls from the sky ; it fills our rivers , it soaks our fields , and we joke about it — it is part of who we are . But in Afghanistan there was no humour ; only heat , dust and desperation . There I saw children trekking miles through the desert , not for food , not for money , but to beg for clean bottled water . Once we have seen that , and once we have felt that fear , we can never take water for granted again . We never again believe it is something we can waste or pollute or privatise without consequence . That is why I have brought forward this Bill : because anger is not enough ; outrage , no matter how justified , will not fix the pipes , stop the sewage or fill the reservoirs . We need a plan . We need a strategy . We need a future . We can do it better . My Water Bill delivers that . It sets out the high standards our country deserves and the democratic governance our water system desperately needs . First , it establishes clear , ambitious targets to stop the sewage in our rivers and on our beaches , to restore our water to high ecological and chemical standards , and to deliver universal , affordable access to water as a basic human right — a right we have never had before in this country . It demands a system designed not just to extract profit but to adapt , to build resilience in the face of climate change , and to harness nature - based solutions that work with the environment , not against it .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-03-28.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-03-28.txt"}, {"score": 37.8033409788185, "chunk_id": "debates2023-09-05_F2", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-09-05.txt", "date": "2023-09-05", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Friend ’ s constituents additionally and more directly .

I recognise that the hon . Gentleman has strong views on this , and I know that he has been personally affected by it in the past . The project , although it has been rephased , will continue . There are a number of issues involved in ensuring tight management of that budget , and I am working closely with the Department for Transport to see that that happens . What assessment he has made with Cabinet colleagues of the potential impact of climate change on the economy . What assessment he has made of the potential impact of climate change on the economy .

The costs of global inaction significantly outweigh the costs of action , and McKinsey estimates that there is a global market opportunity for British businesses worth £1 trillion . A recent report from Carbon Tracker found a huge disconnect between what scientists expect from climate change and what our financial system is prepared for , with flawed economic modelling leading pension funds and others to seriously underestimate the risks . Meanwhile , Energy UK warns that we are lagging behind on green energy investments . Surely the Minister agrees that to revive our economy and avert climate catastrophe we must rapidly phase out fossil fuels and invest in a green new deal to reach net zero . It is important to point out that we are the fastest decarbonising economy in the G7 . Since 1990 , we have decarbonised by 48 % while growing our economy by 65 % , but the hon . Lady is right : this will take a balanced approach involving both public spending and private investment , including pension fund investment . The recent pension fund reforms , for example , should unlock some new assets for green infrastructure . I agree with the question about the Carbon Tracker report . It has found that policy decisions are being based on 1990s literature . That is 30 years old . Will the Chancellor review the data and the thinking that the Government are using to make sure that all strands are in line with the climate science of the 21st century ? The data that I look at shows that last year 40 % of our electricity was generated from renewables . That is an amazing achievement , but we are alive and present when it comes to decarbonising our economy . We have great plans and we are building on our great track record . We will continue to do that . I now welcome our new Member , Steve Tuckwell . Thank you , Mr Speaker . Does my hon . Friend agree with my Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituents that Mayor Khan ’ s ultra low emission zone expansion hits families and businesses without any significant environmental benefit ?

My candid message to them is this : yes , there are real reasons to worry about the world they will inherit , but we can do something about it . Every fraction of a degree of warming that we prevent , and every step we take to preserve nature , helps to limit the severity of impacts and protect our country from irreparable harm . It is our generations today who have a unique opportunity to act , because unlike previous generations , we can see the evidence of the climate and nature crisis all around us , yet we still have time to limit the worst effects . The only answer is to reduce emissions , protect and restore nature and adapt to the impacts that are now inevitable . Let me take those in turn . To those who doubt whether Britain can have any impact on the pathway of global emissions , the lesson of history is that we can . Before the Paris climate agreement was negotiated 10 years ago , the world was on course for 4ºC of global warming . Now , national commitments imply 2 . 6ºC of global warming , or below 2ºC if countries meet their full climate targets . We remain way off track from where we need to be as a world , but we in this country have helped make a difference across parties . In 2008 , this House came together to pass the world ’ s first Climate Change Act .

Now , thanks to the power of our example , nearly 60 countries have similar legislation . In 2019 , under Baroness May , the UK became the first major economy to legislate for net zero by 2050 , supported by the Labour party and parties across this House . Now , in part thanks to the actions at COP26 in Glasgow , including the leadership of Lord Sharma as COP president , some 80 % of global GDP is covered by net zero commitments . In 2021 , England became the first country to introduce a legal duty to halt species decline by 2030 , led by Boris Johnson and supported by parties across the House . Now , 196 countries are signed up to the global biodiversity framework to halt and reverse nature loss . The lesson is clear . The choices we make as a country influence the course of global action and , in doing so , reduce the impact of the climate and nature crisis on future generations in Britain . To those who say that Britain cannot make a difference , I say , “ You are wrong . Stop talking our country down . British leadership matters . ” We also know that climate and nature action has huge potential upsides , and not just for future generations . It has the potential for better lives today in energy security , lower bills , cleaner air , good jobs , better health and wellbeing , and improved access to nature .

Unfortunately , all the evidence suggests that this is just the start of the threat we face . I want to acknowledge in particular the anxieties that many young people feel about these issues . My candid message to them is this : yes , there are real reasons to worry about the world they will inherit , but we can do something about it . Every fraction of a degree of warming that we prevent , and every step we take to preserve nature , helps to limit the severity of impacts and protect our country from irreparable harm . It is our generations today who have a unique opportunity to act , because unlike previous generations , we can see the evidence of the climate and nature crisis all around us , yet we still have time to limit the worst effects . The only answer is to reduce emissions , protect and restore nature and adapt to the impacts that are now inevitable . Let me take those in turn . To those who doubt whether Britain can have any impact on the pathway of global emissions , the lesson of history is that we can . Before the Paris climate agreement was negotiated 10 years ago , the world was on course for 4ºC of global warming . Now , national commitments imply 2 . 6ºC of global warming , or below 2ºC if countries meet their full climate targets . We remain way off track from where we need to be as a world , but we in this country have helped make a difference across parties . In 2008 , this House came together to pass the world ’ s first Climate Change Act . That was under a Labour Government , supported by Lord Cameron , the Conservative party and parties across the House . Now , thanks to the power of our example , nearly 60 countries have similar legislation . In 2019 , under Baroness May , the UK became the first major economy to legislate for net zero by 2050 , supported by the Labour party and parties across this House . Now , in part thanks to the actions at COP26 in Glasgow , including the leadership of Lord Sharma as COP president , some 80 % of global GDP is covered by net zero commitments . In 2021 , England became the first country to introduce a legal duty to halt species decline by 2030 , led by Boris Johnson and supported by parties across the House . Now , 196 countries are signed up to the global biodiversity framework to halt and reverse nature loss . The lesson is clear . The choices we make as a country influence the course of global action and , in doing so , reduce the impact of the climate and nature crisis on future generations in Britain . To those who say that Britain cannot make a difference , I say , “ You are wrong . Stop talking our country down . British leadership matters . ” We also know that climate and nature action has huge potential upsides , and not just for future generations . It has the potential for better lives today in energy security , lower bills , cleaner air , good jobs , better health and wellbeing , and improved access to nature .

While we enrich our lives , how do we ensure we do not impoverish future lives ? What do we want our legacy to be — a world with a strip mine next to a rubbish tip next to a shopping mall , or a world with clean air and drinkable rivers , regenerated soils and vibrant oceans , teeming with wildlife and alive with birdsong ? As I speak , I am looking around to spot my three young friends in the Gallery — Polly , Amber and Bobby from Gloucestershire youth climate group . I spoke to the group recently and , by chance , bumped into them on the train into London this morning . When I was their age , I was blissfully ignorant of the looming environmental crisis : they do not have that luxury . They , and the rest of their generation , will face the consequences of our choice here today . I want to be able to look into their eyes after today ’ s debate and feel proud that this House rose to the challenge , that we did what was necessary , rather than what was politically expedient , and that we pledged to protect their future . What is in the Climate and Nature Bill ? The Bill has been drafted by world - leading climate scientists , ecologists and conservationists , and aims to deliver an integrated plan to tackle the twin climate and nature crises . It would bring massive benefits for local communities , including my constituents in the South Cotswolds : improving the air we breathe ; giving us clean water to drink , swim and row in ; revitalising local populations of cherished wildlife , such as voles , otters , kingfishers and shrews ; and providing cheap energy bills , warmer homes , green jobs , better food and happier lives . The Bill would create a joined - up strategy for the UK to tackle the interconnected climate and nature crises together . It is the only proposed or actual piece of legislation to create the link between the UK ’ s responses to climate change and nature loss . We cannot solve one without tackling the other . We risk making each crisis worse if they are tackled in silos , so the Bill supports a whole - of - Government approach to prevent the issues becoming siloed . Everything in nature is connected with everything else in nature , but sadly not everything in Government is connected with everything else in Government , but it needs to be . Housing , transport and even health are inter - related with climate and nature , so we need a strategy that transcends departmental boundaries . The CAN Bill would enshrine international commitments made by the UK into national legislation to cut emissions and to restore nature by 2030 , as outlined in the global biodiversity framework . The Bill would bring the UK public along with that agenda via a climate and nature assembly , which is key to ensuring that all voices from across our country are heard , enabling workers to transition to low - carbon jobs and ensuring vulnerable communities are protected .

He highlights how everything is interrelated, and suggests an integrated strategy can deliver multiple benefits.\n- Mr. TRAN focuses on personal experiences related to voting, suggesting economic self-determination and energy abundance are crucial issues in climate change policies.\n- The Personal Explanation by HON. Derek TRAN underlines technical details related to voting technology failures, highlighting the need for robust systems that accurately record votes.\n\nThere's an emphasis among some speakers, like Mr. FITZGERALD who congratulates Gold Award Girl Scouts, on the positive impacts and leadership of young people in addressing climate challenges through their activities. \n\nIn contrast, HON. Scott Fitzgerald in his statement mentions significant negative impacts (40% of emissions from the built environment) without explicitly mentioning economic opportunity but rather focuses on the necessity to decarbonize housing stock for core mission growth. He highlights innovative solutions and policies like Great British Energy and warm homes plan which can address climate change while promoting economic activity.\n\nThus, there is a mix of focusing on both ecological crises (existential crisis) versus potential economic opportunities tied to addressing climate issues.

This implies an emphasis on the economic and social impacts of proposed solutions rather than purely focusing on the existential threat of climate change.\n\nIn [Doc 5], there is commentary indicating that some political actors may be framing climate change as a wedge issue, suggesting they are seeing opportunities for creating division through polarizing rhetoric. The use of terms like \"weaponize\" and \"eco-zealots\" imply an emphasis on perceived threats to conservative interests rather than the existential urgency of addressing climate change.\n\nGiven these documents, the answer seems to highlight that while there is a common acknowledgment of climate change as a significant issue (as evidenced in all provided documents), the specific emphases differ between seeing it primarily as an economic or social crisis versus its potential for creating division.

To serve the British people we must tackle these problems head - on , because they do not stop at our borders — and that is the fundamental point . At every meeting I had at COP and the G20 , and in every agreement I entered into , my focus was on tackling these problems to deliver growth and security for the British people . At COP , I made the case that we must act on climate change and nature loss as some of the greatest long - term threats we face , and in doing so we must seize the opportunities of the low - carbon economy for investment , for UK businesses and for British workers . At COP , I was proud to announce the UK ’ s new nationally determined contribution , with a 2035 target to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 81 % on 1990 levels .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-11-21.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-11-21.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2023-11-08.txt | debates2023-11-08_P0_C4 | 2023-11-08 | UK", "debates2023-11-09.txt | debates2023-11-09_P0_C2 | 2023-11-09 | UK", "debates2024-09-05.txt | debates2024-09-05_P13_C5 | 2024-09-05 | UK", "debates2024-09-05.txt | debates2024-09-05_P2_C5 | 2024-09-05 | UK", "debates2024-11-21.txt | debates2024-11-21_P14_C1 | 2024-11-21 | UK", "debates2024-11-26.txt | debates2024-11-26_P19_C3 | 2024-11-26 | UK", "debates2025-01-17.txt | debates2025-01-17_P1_C4 | 2025-01-17 | UK", "debates2025-07-14.txt | debates2025-07-14_P19_C1 | 2025-07-14 | UK"], "answer": "The emphasis seems to shift based on the perspective of each speaker. Initially, there are concerns about the current system's inefficacy in addressing householders' confusion and the need for proper communication. This aligns with an emphasis on the existence of a problem (existential crisis) rather than solely economic opportunity.\n\nHowever, as more recent documents suggest, some speakers highlight the economic opportunities that arise from tackling climate change. For instance, [Doc 6] mentions \"the new Government, specifically the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change have moved the conversation along\" indicating a shift towards economic incentives.\n\nOn the other hand, there are voices emphasizing the economic challenges posed by climate change as well. For example, [Doc 3] states that we must redouble our efforts to tackle climate change, while [Doc 4] criticizes the Government's approach and suggests language is alienating people from important causes like ensuring a better planet for future generations.\n\nTherefore, the rhetoric on climate change varies between speakers focusing on both economic opportunities and an existential crisis. There isn't a clear dominance of either side in all documents, suggesting that both dimensions are often addressed within discussions about climate change.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T17:33:22"}

Google ’ s Willow announcement is one of several important milestones achieved by companies developing quantum computers in recent months , globally and in the UK . The announcement does not change our policy to maintain UK leadership across a range of quantum computing platforms . Learning from the successful Y2K , or year 2000 , prevention of systems failures , what progress has the Secretary of State made in considering post - quantum cryptography to prevent the so - called Y2Q — year to quantum — end of privacy , and what support is being provided for the development of quantum computing in the UK after the recent announcement of the Willow chip ? I am grateful for the hon . Member ’ s question . He will know full well that there are breakthroughs in quantum happening all the time . These breakthroughs are often happening because of the scientific endeavours in our country , of which we should be proud . On encryption , the Government have a set of policies to ensure that our systems and our country are prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the quantum era , and those policies remain active as we speak . On investment in quantum , I was up in Glasgow not so long ago announcing £100 million for five quantum hubs . That is the kind of investment he can expect from this Government to keep our country at the cutting edge . What steps his Department is taking to make digital services easier to access for small businesses in the north - east . No one anywhere in the UK should have difficulty using Government services , and the Government are committed to ensuring that our online and digital services are as accessible as possible . There are globally recognised standards for digital accessibility , but they are only part of the design of an inclusive service , which is why we will be revising the Government service standards to incorporate requirements covering wider issues of inclusion and looking at extending their scope into the wider public sector . Recently , I attended a roundtable of small businesses in the north - east , held at Sage , and a key theme was the need for good connections and digital services to help their businesses to grow . Digital connectivity is of course critical , but this often holds people back . What are the Government doing to ensure that digital infrastructure is strong enough to support local businesses in constituencies such as mine ? It is right that not only do we need to have good online access to services , but businesses need to be able to connect to those services , and that is why the Government are committed to delivering nationwide gigabit connectivity coverage by 2030 . I am glad to say that over 94 % of premises in her constituency can access gigabit broadband , including the businesses that she refers to , but I am of course happy to meet her to talk about what more we can do in this important area . The Sussex Bookshop is a new bookshop that opened in Chichester city centre in December ; it is now February and it is unable to connect to any sort of internet provision , because Openreach is reporting that there are no extra connections for the whole city centre .

In fact , a record - breaking number of nationals from our adversary , China , are illegally crossing our border . In April , the Customs and Border Patrol found that in this fiscal year alone , they have encountered 27 , 583 Chinese nationals , a nearly 8 , 000 percent increase from fiscal year 2021 . With the rising threat of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , border security is paramount to national security and I will not relent in the fight to secure America & # x27 ; s borders . I recently spoke on the House floor about how the fentanyl pouring in through our borders has taken lives in our own communities in the mountains and urged that this administration put the American people first and close our southern border once and for all . The U . S . must stand with Israel As our ally , Israel , is defending itself from terrorist organizations , it is critical that we continue to stand with and support Israel . The president recently announced he would stop military aid to Israel at a time when this aid is needed to target Hamas terrorists and avoid more civilian casualties in what [ [ Page E563 ] ] looks like an attempt to appease the growing pro - Hamas sentiment among the left . In light of this administration & # x27 ; s misguided decision to halt military aid to Israel , a bipartisan group of colleagues and I demanded that the president provide answers on his decision to withhold shipments to Israel . Furthermore , the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) issued baseless arrest warrants for Israeli officials , equating them to the terrorists who committed the horrific attacks of Oct . 7 . The ICC & # x27 ; s decision is great news to terrorists around the globe and is a slap in the face to the only free - standing democracy in the Middle East . If I have my way , the United States will never abandon Israel , especially not while it is fighting for the right to exist and the rights of Jewish people everywhere , and no country should recognize any legitimacy of a pro - terrorist international court . Protecting Americans & # x27 ; right to financial privacy President Biden released a framework to evaluate the establishment of a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ) , which can be used as a surveillance tool and weaponized against the American people . In China , the Communist Party has been using a CBDC to track the spending habits of its citizens and we cannot allow this level of financial surveillance in America . That & # x27 ; s why I cast NC - 11 & # x27 ; s vote for the CBDC Anti - Surveillance State Act . This bill protects Americans & # x27 ; right to financial privacy by halting unelected bureaucrats from issuing a CBDC and is the first anti - central bank digital currency legislative effort ever introduced in Congress . WNC Backs the Blue During the past three years , the Defund the Police movement and anti - police policies have led to a surge in violent crime across the country . In the U . S .

I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . Strong encryption is vital for everyone ’ s security , but last week Apple pulled its advanced data protection services in the UK after the Home Office had reportedly demanded back - door access to its UK customers ’ encrypted data . Liberal Democrats have long argued that investigatory powers must be proportionate , as any “ way in ” for security services can be exploited by criminal gangs or , indeed , hostile states to target innocent people . Given that rights and security go hand in hand , what steps is the Minister taking to ensure that our national security and civil liberties are properly protected ? Why do the Government believe that Apple ’ s UK customers do not deserve the same privacy rights as every other customer in the rest of the world ? I hope the hon . Lady will understand that I cannot comment on operational matters , and it would not be appropriate for me either to confirm or to deny the existence of any notices under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 . This is a long - standing position held by successive Governments for obvious reasons of national security . What I can say is that the suggestion that privacy and security are at odds is not correct ; we can and must have both . The Investigatory Powers Act contains robust safeguards and independent oversight to protect privacy and ensure that data is obtained only on an exceptional basis , and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so . If she will make a statement on her departmental responsibilities . I call the Home Secretary . Thank you , Mr Speaker . “ My son didn ’ t stand a chance . ” Those were the heartbreaking words of Pooja Kanda , whose teenage son Ronan was fatally stabbed in 2022 . His teenage killers were able to buy multiple dangerous weapons online , without any proper checks . Following Pooja ’ s campaigning , we are introducing Ronan ’ s law , which includes tightening the rules for online retailers , increasing the maximum penalty for selling weapons to under - 18s , and introducing much more stringent ID checks at the point of purchase and delivery . I thank Commander Stephen Clayman for his crucial review in this area , which underpins the reforms , and pay tribute to the Kanda family . We need to do everything in our power to prevent other families from suffering from terrible knife crime . Thames Valley police are £1 . 9 million down this year because of the flawed formula for distributing funds to police forces after a pay award is given . When will this historical anomaly be fixed ? I will just point out to the hon . Gentleman that his party had 14 years to address all the things he is so concerned about now . This Government have increased funding for policing by up to £1 . 1 billion next year , including £200 million to start redressing the huge cuts in neighbourhood policing that we have seen on our streets in Thames Valley and right across the country , because we need to get police back on the streets .

I welcome the hon . Gentleman to his place . If he wants to know what the targets are , I suggest that he reads the plan for change ; they are set out very carefully in it . On the lists of processes , I said that we were focused on outcomes . That is why today we have announced reform of the judicial review process to stop repeated , and often lengthy and hugely expensive , actions that delay important investment projects that are in the national interest . I would have thought that he would have welcomed that . What recent progress his Department has made on strengthening cyber security . What recent progress his Department has made on strengthening cyber security . The battle to ensure protection against cyber - attacks is constant and ongoing . I made a speech to the NATO cyber - defence conference a couple of months ago , and said that the Government are taking action to strengthen our cyber - security and protect our digital economy to deliver economic growth . Last week , we announced important proposals to protect UK businesses from ransomware , the most harmful cyber - crime , which can often cost a lot of money and do a lot of damage . Those measures will complement the Cyber Security and Resilience Bill , which is being introduced this Session , to help to make the UK safer from cyber - threats . Given the critical importance of closing the skills gap across the Government and defence sectors to safeguard against emerging threats in this digital age , which worry my constituents of Stoke - on - Trent South , what plans do the Government have to collaborate with organisations such as Code First Girls to develop a skilled and inclusive cyber - workforce , as highlighted in the artificial intelligence opportunities action plan ? I welcome my hon . Friend ’ s question . The AI opportunities action plan gives us great opportunities and shows how seriously we take this matter . I know that organisations such as Code First Girls are doing important work providing free coding courses for women . I thank them for that . It is really important in pursuing this plan that we have the skilled people to do it . I am pleased to say that much of the cyber - security work in Government is led by outstanding women . We want more people with the right skills , so well done to Code First Girls , which we look forward to continuing to work with . Between July 2023 and 2024 , over 150 cyber - incidents were reported by the local government sector in the UK . Last year , the average ransom demand from a ransomware attack was over £2 . 2 million . As the local government sector does not pay ransoms , the average cost to our councils of recovering from a ransomware attack is approximately £12 million . Will my right hon . Friend therefore make additional support available to local authorities to enhance their cyber - security and protect local services for constituents such as mine in Stevenage ? My hon . Friend is right to draw attention to the threat to local authorities . This is a whole - system threat .

Learning from the successful Y2K , or year 2000 , prevention of systems failures , what progress has the Secretary of State made in considering post - quantum cryptography to prevent the so - called Y2Q — year to quantum — end of privacy , and what support is being provided for the development of quantum computing in the UK after the recent announcement of the Willow chip ? I am grateful for the hon . Member ’ s question . He will know full well that there are breakthroughs in quantum happening all the time . These breakthroughs are often happening because of the scientific endeavours in our country , of which we should be proud . On encryption , the Government have a set of policies to ensure that our systems and our country are prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the quantum era , and those policies remain active as we speak . On investment in quantum , I was up in Glasgow not so long ago announcing £100 million for five quantum hubs . That is the kind of investment he can expect from this Government to keep our country at the cutting edge . What steps his Department is taking to make digital services easier to access for small businesses in the north - east . No one anywhere in the UK should have difficulty using Government services , and the Government are committed to ensuring that our online and digital services are as accessible as possible . There are globally recognised standards for digital accessibility , but they are only part of the design of an inclusive service , which is why we will be revising the Government service standards to incorporate requirements covering wider issues of inclusion and looking at extending their scope into the wider public sector . Recently , I attended a roundtable of small businesses in the north - east , held at Sage , and a key theme was the need for good connections and digital services to help their businesses to grow . Digital connectivity is of course critical , but this often holds people back . What are the Government doing to ensure that digital infrastructure is strong enough to support local businesses in constituencies such as mine ? It is right that not only do we need to have good online access to services , but businesses need to be able to connect to those services , and that is why the Government are committed to delivering nationwide gigabit connectivity coverage by 2030 . I am glad to say that over 94 % of premises in her constituency can access gigabit broadband , including the businesses that she refers to , but I am of course happy to meet her to talk about what more we can do in this important area . The Sussex Bookshop is a new bookshop that opened in Chichester city centre in December ; it is now February and it is unable to connect to any sort of internet provision , because Openreach is reporting that there are no extra connections for the whole city centre .

It is clear that we need to act on recent public inquiries that have called for reform , such as those into the Grenfell Tower tragedy and the covid - 19 pandemic . That is why the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is leading a review into national resilience against the range of risks the UK faces .

My hon . Friend is right to raise that question . As the Environment Secretary has said , it is a matter of some regret that the previous Administration left our country ’ s flood defences in the worst condition ever recorded , and it is communities such as my hon . Friend ’ s that have unfortunately had to pay the price . I can assure him that the resilience review will strengthen our approach to resilience across the whole range of risks that we face , including those in his constituency . We have already taken steps to improve resilience across government . If we are to ensure that the UK is resilient to the potential threats that face our country , it is vital that people who work to bring communities together and keep us safe are given the training , knowledge and skills that they need to play their part . My constituency of Stoke - on - Trent South knows the importance of that more than most , with people working tirelessly to tackle and calm the racial tension at the centre of the violent disorder we saw over the summer . Organisations such as the Emergency Planning College do fantastic work to deliver crisis management and resilience training . Can the Minister tell the House what steps she is taking to support their work in that area ? My hon . Friend is absolutely right , and in September I was delighted to visit the Emergency Planning College , which has served as the UK Government ’ s centre for resilience expertise since its founding 80 years ago .

In this very fast - moving world , we need to be fleet of foot . I think the truth is that the technology develops much faster than we make legislation , and that is a nut that we have to crack . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . I , too , thank the previous ministerial team and welcome the new one — I very much look forward to working together . Following the roll - out of the Online Safety Act , there is evidence that harmful content is still being algorithmically shown to young children and that artificial intelligence technologies , which have been linked to teenage deaths , are not covered properly in the Act , and concerns have been raised about data protection and inappropriately age - gated educational content . We must get the Act right , so will the Secretary of State consider our calls for a digital Bill of Rights to set the standard , in order that we can truly adapt to this era of technological change ? We do need to adapt to this age of phenomenal technological development . I have already had a discussion with the chief executive of Ofcom and I intend to meet many other organisations , including those that champion stronger protections for children online . The hon . Lady raises the critical issue that we need to protect people ’ s privacy , and we need to protect freedom of speech , but we also need to make sure that illegal content , and harmful content for children , is removed . I will leave no stone unturned in delivering on that objective . What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help support the adoption of new technologies in the workplace . New technology in the workplace can help companies become more productive and efficient . In making workplaces more accessible so that people can get work and stay in work , it is also good for people . We are supporting companies in a number of ways , especially through our industrial strategy , and we have seen great examples of UK firms adopting tech — artificial intelligence , in particular — ahead of their international peers . We want to do all we can to support companies in this area , and I am determined to take action on that . I welcome the Secretary of State to her place . Small businesses in my constituency are vital to economic growth . What is her Department doing to ensure that small businesses can benefit from innovation and new technology ? The hon . Gentleman raises a really important point . My own constituency is dominated by small businesses , and one issue that they always raise is that we are great at start - ups in this country but we need to do more to help those companies to scale up . I am new in the job and open to ideas , so if the hon . Gentleman and the businesses in his constituency would like to say what they think they need to help them go from start - up to scale - up , I would be more than happy to listen to them . I call the Chair of the Select Committee .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-10.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-10.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["2024-05-24.txt | 2024-05-24_F3 | 2024-05-24 | US", "debates2024-10-24.txt | debates2024-10-24_F9 | 2024-10-24 | UK", "debates2025-01-23.txt | debates2025-01-23_F2 | 2025-01-23 | UK", "debates2025-02-12.txt | debates2025-02-12_F5 | 2025-02-12 | UK", "debates2025-02-24.txt | debates2025-02-24_F13 | 2025-02-24 | UK", "debates2025-06-02.txt | debates2025-06-02_F9 | 2025-06-02 | UK", "debates2025-07-10.txt | debates2025-07-10_F10 | 2025-07-10 | UK", "debates2025-09-10.txt | debates2025-09-10_F3 | 2025-09-10 | UK"], "answer": "The central tension highlighted by several ministers' speeches revolves around balancing the need for robust national security measures, particularly in areas such as cybersecurity and combating fraud, with protecting citizens' privacy. This is evident from various points raised:\n\n1. **National Security vs. Privacy**: While acknowledging that strong protections against fraud and cybercrime are necessary to maintain national security, ministers like the Home Office minister stress the importance of not compromising individual privacy rights.\n\n2. **Speed of Legislation vs. Technology Development**: There's a tension between the slow pace at which laws can be updated compared to how quickly technologies evolve, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and online safety.\n\n3. **Balancing Protection Against Dangerous Content**: Some ministers address concerns about harmful content being shown on platforms despite existing legislation but express interest in further protections under proposed digital rights frameworks.\n\n4. **Striking the Right Balance**: The overarching challenge is to find a balanced approach that allows for the necessary measures to protect national security while also safeguarding citizens' privacy and freedoms, particularly from potential overreach of surveillance or restrictions on technology use.\n\nIn essence, there is a need to strike a balance between what can be achieved quickly through legislation versus the slow but crucial evolution of digital technologies, all while ensuring that no individual's fundamental rights are infringed upon. This tension requires continuous dialogue and adaptation as new challenges arise in the evolving digital landscape.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T17:35:26"}

Moving on , after President Trump ’ s national security adviser accidentally added a journalist to a group chat that was discussing military action in Yemen , and given all the concerns that we share about President Trump ’ s relationship with Vladimir Putin and JD Vance ’ s insulting disdain for Britain and our armed forces , will the Prime Minister order an urgent review into the security of the intelligence that we share with the United States ? We work with the United States on a daily basis . I think that the right hon . Gentleman would like to think of himself as reasonable and , when he is not jumping in Windermere , quite serious , but unpicking our relations with the US on defence and security is neither responsible nor serious . Medina from Lyminge in my constituency is registered blind . She recently told me how she had been failed by the broken social security system left behind by the Conservatives . She faced great difficulties getting support from Access to Work , which is essential across my constituency , and was not helped to find paid employment . It is so important that disabled people who want to work are supported to do so . What is the Prime Minister ’ s message to Medina and others like her , who have been abandoned and shut out of employment for far too long ? Every person should have the right to work , and we will always protect the most severely disabled and those with lifelong health conditions . We need to support Medina and the 200 , 000 others like her who can and want to work . That is why we are investing £1 billion in personalised and tailored employment programmes and introducing the right to try work guarantee . The Conservative party presided over a failed system that did not help them and then blamed them . We will never do that . Those who know me well know that I do not talk of this often , but for half of my adult life I was physically disabled . When I first walked through the doors of this Chamber , I did so with a crutch on my right arm to support my body weight . I know how it feels .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-03-26.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-03-26.txt"}, {"score": 0.6174013614654541, "chunk_id": "debates2024-04-25_F2", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-04-25.txt", "date": "2024-04-25", "parliament": "UK", "text": "What steps his Department is taking to protect public institutions and services from cyber threats . What steps his Department is taking to protect public institutions and services from cyber threats . The cyber threat facing the United Kingdom is intensifying . State and non - state actors have targeted our critical national infrastructure , our businesses and even our democratic institutions . The Government have introduced a new national cyber strategy , which takes a whole - of - society approach . We have set out high standards of cyber - protection for our critical industries and , with the help of our world - leading agencies , we are offering advice to institutions , businesses and individuals on protecting themselves online . Cyber - security is crucial not only to our defence sector but to others , including finance , energy and retail . Sector leaders have raised fears about the future supply of cyber professionals . There is some brilliant work taking place at Ebbw Vale College in my constituency — pioneering stuff is going on around cyber - security — but can the Deputy Prime Minister say what is being done to onshore these critical roles to protect our economy from attacks by hostile actors ? The hon . Gentleman is absolutely right to raise this issue . We have tremendous strengths in national cyber - security , and there are many relevant institutions around the country . I have visited universities in Wales that are churning out brilliant graduates . We need to do more at secondary school level to encourage more children to get involved in cyber - security , because the demand is only going to increase in the months and years ahead , and I have been engaging with the Education Secretary on precisely this point . We have all seen in recent weeks how weak cyber - security can compromise elected representatives and lead to the extraction of often compromising information . Could the Minister update the House on what he is doing to provide support and technology specifically to elected representatives to make sure that this does not happen in the future ? This is an important issue , which is why we established the National Cyber Security Centre . It brings together Government Communications Headquarters expertise with that of the Cabinet Office , the Foreign Office and others . Through the National Cyber Security Centre , we work with the House authorities and others to make sure that they have sufficient and appropriate advice , but also to advise on equipment and the general security of Members of Parliament . If they have concerns about their cyber - security , I would urge them either to get in contact directly with the National Security Cyber Centre or to do so through the relevant House authorities . I call the shadow Minister . The Secretary of State is right to say that the threat is intensifying . Late last year , the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy urged the Government to offer more active support on cyber - security to local authorities . He may be aware that last month my own local authority , Leicester City Council , suffered a hugely sophisticated attack , which disrupted many local authority services and has hugely inconvenienced many of my constituents , who rely on those services . Given that we are seeing more of these ransomware group attacks on public institutions across the world and that he says , rightly , that the threat is intensifying , what urgent support and guidance is he offering local councils , such as mine in Leicester ? Specifically in relation to the hon . Gentleman ’ s local authority , I have been briefed by the National Cyber Security Centre on that incident .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-25.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-25.txt"}, {"score": 0.6152395606040955, "chunk_id": "2023-09-12_F6", "parent_id": null, "filename": "2023-09-12.txt", "date": "2023-09-12", "parliament": "US", "text": "NORTON . Mr . Speaker , today , I introduce the United States Commission on an Open Society with Security Act of 2023 , which would create a commission to investigate how we can maintain our democratic traditions while actively responding to the real and substantial threats posed by foreign and domestic terrorism . The impetus for this commission was the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 , its importance grew after the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 , and has reached peak urgency since the insurrectionist attack on the U . S . Capitol on January 6 , 2021 . The succession of tragic events endured by our Nation has led to a series of sweeping security increases that are deemed both necessary and temporary in the moment but create lasting security infrastructure that is difficult to dismantle and infringes on our open , democratic society . We must acknowledge and accept that we have entered an era of constant internal and external threats , requiring ever - higher levels of security for our people and public spaces . What we thought would be a temporary infringement on our open society has turned into a permanent restriction on how our citizens interact with each other and our democratic institutions . Because emergencies typically dictate security decisions , essential discussions on the proper balance between security , individual rights and the freedoms enjoyed in an open society have been repeatedly deferred . This bill would ensure that these long overdue discussions take place in a public forum with experts drawn from across the spectrum . To date , security planning has been delegated almost exclusively to security , intelligence and military experts . Although their input is indispensable , they cannot be expected to consider matters outside of their expertise . To strike a better balance that gives sufficient importance to our democratic traditions , we need to invite experts from diverse fields to the same table to work together . Therefore , the commission would be composed not only of security , intelligence and military experts , but also experts from such fields as business , architecture , technology , law , city planning , art , engineering , philosophy , history , sociology and psychology . We have used commissions before to deeply investigate and address unprecedented challenges , such as the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States ( also known as the 9 / 11 Commission ) , the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction ( also known as the Silberman Robb Commission ) and the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders ( also known as the Kerner Commission ) . The commission created by this bill would seek to avert a crisis in basic freedoms before their infringement becomes entrenched . We cannot allow security protocols to proliferate without informed civilian oversight and a thorough analysis of alternatives that might better safeguard freedom and commerce . Furthermore , we have had decades to develop security strategies and technologies that do not deprive our citizens of access to institutions and personal liberty . Thus far , we have either relied on imprecise , medieval approaches like crude barriers or on intrusive new technologies that treat privacy like a privilege instead of a right . We can , and must , do better . As the home of our federal government , the District of Columbia & # x27 ; s residents have suffered disproportionate infringement on public spaces , personal rights and freedoms in the name of security . Public spaces that serve as the heart of our local communities have become restricted zones characterized by a heavy security presence , with individuals liable to be reprimanded for walking on the wrong side of the street or marveling too long at the architecture .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\US\\2023-09-12.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/US/2023-09-12.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["2023-09-12.txt | 2023-09-12_F6 | 2023-09-12 | US", "debates2024-04-25.txt | debates2024-04-25_F2 | 2024-04-25 | UK", "debates2025-02-24.txt | debates2025-02-24_F13 | 2025-02-24 | UK", "debates2025-03-26.txt | debates2025-03-26_F15 | 2025-03-26 | UK", "debates2025-10-22.txt | debates2025-10-22_F11 | 2025-10-22 | UK"], "answer": "The central tension that emerges from the speeches involves the balance between ensuring robust national security measures to protect against threats, while also safeguarding citizens' privacy rights.

I can say to him that a threat is a threat , regardless of the direction from which it comes . We take all those threats extremely seriously , and we work around the clock with the police and the operational agencies to keep the public safe , wherever the threat may originate . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson . Strong encryption is vital for everyone ’ s security , but last week Apple pulled its advanced data protection services in the UK after the Home Office had reportedly demanded back - door access to its UK customers ’ encrypted data . Liberal Democrats have long argued that investigatory powers must be proportionate , as any “ way in ” for security services can be exploited by criminal gangs or , indeed , hostile states to target innocent people . Given that rights and security go hand in hand , what steps is the Minister taking to ensure that our national security and civil liberties are properly protected ? Why do the Government believe that Apple ’ s UK customers do not deserve the same privacy rights as every other customer in the rest of the world ? I hope the hon . Lady will understand that I cannot comment on operational matters , and it would not be appropriate for me either to confirm or to deny the existence of any notices under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 . This is a long - standing position held by successive Governments for obvious reasons of national security . What I can say is that the suggestion that privacy and security are at odds is not correct ; we can and must have both . The Investigatory Powers Act contains robust safeguards and independent oversight to protect privacy and ensure that data is obtained only on an exceptional basis , and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so . If she will make a statement on her departmental responsibilities . I call the Home Secretary . Thank you , Mr Speaker . “ My son didn ’ t stand a chance . ” Those were the heartbreaking words of Pooja Kanda , whose teenage son Ronan was fatally stabbed in 2022 . His teenage killers were able to buy multiple dangerous weapons online , without any proper checks . Following Pooja ’ s campaigning , we are introducing Ronan ’ s law , which includes tightening the rules for online retailers , increasing the maximum penalty for selling weapons to under - 18s , and introducing much more stringent ID checks at the point of purchase and delivery . I thank Commander Stephen Clayman for his crucial review in this area , which underpins the reforms , and pay tribute to the Kanda family . We need to do everything in our power to prevent other families from suffering from terrible knife crime . Thames Valley police are £1 . 9 million down this year because of the flawed formula for distributing funds to police forces after a pay award is given . When will this historical anomaly be fixed ? I will just point out to the hon . Gentleman that his party had 14 years to address all the things he is so concerned about now . This Government have increased funding for policing by up to £1 . 1 billion next year , including £200 million to start redressing the huge cuts in neighbourhood policing that we have seen on our streets in Thames Valley and right across the country , because we need to get police back on the streets .

Claire ’ s bravery and her campaign are humbling , and today I am pleased that we can announce that we will repeal the presumption of parental involvement , putting children ’ s safety first . This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others . In addition to my duties in this House , I shall have further such meetings later today . I associate myself with the Prime Minister ’ s sympathies extended towards Claire , and I commend her for her bravery . I regret to inform the House that yesterday there was a very serious breach of national security , when my Prime Minister ’ s question was photographed heading into No . 10 in a transparent folder . The nation can rest easy , as on this occasion no state secrets were revealed . However , it does make me wonder whether this Government can be trusted with a digital ID scheme that is mandatory in all but name . [ Laughter . ] I like to keep the Prime Minister on his toes . Will he reverse this misguided scheme , or will he persist with a plan that makes all of our personal data vulnerable to hacks and attacks ? I thank the hon . Member for her question . The whole point of digital ID , of course , is that you cannot see it , so that should at least deal with her first concern . It is important that we make access to public services as easy as possible for people . We all know the difficulties that so many people have with accessing services , and digital ID has been shown in other countries to help . I do think this is an important step forward . I also think it is very important as part of our plan to tackle those who are entering our country illegally . The number of households in Cornwall in temporary accommodation has increased by 265 % in five years , so I am delighted that this Labour Government are investing £39 billion in social and affordable housing . In Cornwall we are developing a strategy to provide housing at sites such as Pydar in my constituency , which needs support from Homes England . Will the Prime Minister arrange for us to meet the Housing Minister at our Homes Cornwall launch next month , to accelerate discussions on a strategic partnership for Cornwall so that we can build the right homes in the right places for local people ? I know that the Housing Minister will be delighted to meet my hon . Friend to help unlock new homes for her constituents . We are working closely with local authorities through our small sites aggregator to build new affordable homes on brownfield sites . My goal is to restore the dream of home ownership , which was stolen by the Opposition when they were in government . I call the Leader of the Opposition . May I first pay tribute to the former Conservative MP Oliver Colvile , who has very sadly passed away after a long illness ? Colleagues will remember him for his love of cricket and , of course , hedgehogs . He will be very much missed .

We have had disturbing reports that the Government are considering scrapping the digital services tax and watering down Britain ’ s online safety legislation to appease President Trump and his co - president , Elon Musk . Will the Prime Minister categorically rule out both those things , and make it clear that he will guarantee that British laws on tax and social media will be written in this House , and not the White House ? Yes of course , as the right hon . Gentleman well knows . Online safety is important , and important new measures are coming in the next few months under the Act .

Friend the Member for Tottenham ( Mr Lammy ) set out in his statement to the House following the conclusion of the China audit , we are investing £600 million in our intelligence services to support them in detecting and disrupting state threats to the UK . In September , the National Cyber Security Centre co - sealed a US - led technical advisory calling out Chinese state - sponsored cyber - threat actors targeting global networks , including in the UK . I know there will be calls to go further , and I reassure the House and the country that we will keep all tools under review and act as necessary . As you are aware , Mr Speaker , the safety and security of our Parliament is of the utmost importance . That is why the National Protective Security Authority will issue new protective security guidance to parliamentarians and political staff on protection against foreign interference and espionage . That guidance outlines the potential risks we all may face in our day - to - day work , and how we can all better protect ourselves . I urge colleagues to read and follow the advice once issued . I also urge Members to take up the National Cyber Security Centre ’ s important opt - in service for Members of both Houses . It allows the NCSC to alert individuals if it identifies evidence of malicious activity on their personal devices or accounts , and swiftly advise them on steps to take to protect their information . The strategic defence review was clear that China presents a sophisticated and persistent challenge . As the national security strategy reinforced , instances of China ’ s espionage , interference in our democracy and undermining of our economic security have increased in recent years . As I have set out , we are addressing those threats , but there are also opportunities we need to grasp as we navigate our complex relationship with China . The last Government did not describe China as an enemy , and this Government do not think our relationship can be simplified down to a single word . Instead , we are taking a consistent , long - term approach to China , firmly rooted in the UK ’ s global interests . I finish by paying tribute to our law enforcement , security and intelligence agencies , who do so much to keep us all safe . They operate often in secret , often in the shadows and often at great personal danger , but they have our enduring gratitude . While we are extremely disappointed with the outcome in this case , the legislation it relied on has already been changed . Should we need to go further , we will not hesitate to do what is necessary to keep our country safe . I commend this statement to the House . I call the shadow Home Secretary . Let me start by thanking the Security Minister for the briefing and information he provided ahead of his statement . Let me also join him in paying tribute to the officers in our police force and in the security service . They work so hard and take personal risks to keep us safe . Let us start with Parliament ’ s Intelligence and Security Committee ’ s assessment of China , published a year or two ago . It found that China had penetrated every sector of our economy . When the Security Minister a moment ago said that China merely posed a “ challenge ” , he was wrong I think to use that word . China poses a threat . It poses a threat because it participates and organises systemic espionage into our public institutions , including Parliament .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-15.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-15.txt"}, {"score": 0.6070860624313354, "chunk_id": "debates2024-04-17_F5", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-04-17.txt", "date": "2024-04-17", "parliament": "UK", "text": "AI , fakes and the protection of data is one element of that , but I assure the House that we are taking a whole range of measures to ensure that the protection of the coming general election is robust . I call the SNP spokesperson . Individuals ’ personal data is not safe in Tory hands . A recent article in The Guardian reported that senior Tory party officials planned to make millions from selling off their own members ’ data through the “ True Blue ” app . If the Tory party is happy to sell off its own members ’ personal data , how can the public possibly have confidence that their data is safe under the Government ? The allegations that the hon . Lady has put forward were written in The Guardian , and I have not seen them myself . I am presiding over the data Bill , and I have seen no evidence to suggest that we are trying to bring forward laws that would do such a thing . What steps her Department is taking to implement the Online Safety Act 2023 . Ofcom is the independent regulator of the Online Safety Act . The Government are working with it to implement the Act as quickly as possible , including the relevant secondary legislation . Ofcom is taking a phased approach to bringing the duties into effect and is consulting on guidance and codes of practice . Offences around serious online abuse came into effect on 31 January this year . The Online Safety Act introduced many measures to keep children safe , but given the increased concerns about children ’ s online safety , does the Secretary of State agree that it is time to go even further and introduce a child - safe phone ? That would ensure that , at a minimum , all phones intended for children are properly fitted with parental controls to stop children accessing harmful content . The Government produced world - leading legislation on online safety , which puts the onus on social media companies , not parents . I know that my right hon . Friend has spoken about information , which is particularly important to make it as easy as possible for parents . She raises an important about device - level controls , and I assure her that I am listening not just to Members of this House but to parents . Yesterday , the Government finally backed Labour ’ s calls and announced that they would make the creation of deepfake porn a criminal offence . However , it is disappointing that the Government continue to adopt an intent - based approach over one of consent in relation to these crimes . Why are Ministers prioritising a man ’ s right to have banter over a woman ’ s right to feel safe ? Will the Government look at the regulation of AI apps such as Nudify and ClothOff , which are freely available , easy to use and exist only to humiliate and violate women ? I share the hon . Member ’ s passion in this area , which is why we put it in the Online Safety Act with regard to the sharing of that content . We have now gone one step further , and are in the process of making it illegal to create that content in the first place . What assessment her Department has made of the potential impact of AI on democracy . The Government are clear that artificial intelligence is the defining technology of our time , with the potential to transform humanity positively . We also recognise the challenges that AI can pose . As has been said , we are working to ensure that we respond to the full range of threats to our democratic processes , including through the defending democracy taskforce .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-17.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-17.txt"}, {"score": 0.6069352626800537, "chunk_id": "debates2025-09-09_F24", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-09-09.txt", "date": "2025-09-09", "parliament": "UK", "text": "In that regard , we heard from Ciaran Martin , former head of the National Cyber Security Centre , on the “ Today ” programme this morning , suggesting that companies are perhaps focusing more on protecting customer data at the expense of the security of their operations . This House needs to hear more in the coming months about what the Government are doing to work with business and to help prevent these attacks being successful , because they are a threat to our economy and to national security . First , I commend my hon . Friend on seeking this urgent question and you , Mr Speaker , on granting it . My hon . Friend makes the important point that Jaguar Land Rover is not only an iconic national brand , but a very significant employer — it employs 34 , 000 people in the UK , including in his constituency , and 39 , 000 worldwide . He is right that we need to ensure that cyber - security is something that every company in the land take seriously , and every public sector organisation . In my previous ministerial role I was conscious of the attack on the British Library , which was actually one of the most financially significant attacks heretofore , and it pointed the way for some of the other issues arising across the economy , which is why we have been keen to bring forward a Bill on this , as stated in the King ’ s Speech . We will introduce such a Bill “ soon ” — I think I can get away with that with the Chief Whip and the Leader of the House , although , in the words of Humpty Dumpty , when I use a word it means precisely what I choose it to mean , no more and certainly no less . As my hon . Friend says , there are serious issues that we need to address across the whole of the economy to ensure that we get this right . My hon . Friend pointed to one person ; I point to another — Richard Horne , the chief executive officer of the National Cyber Security Centre — who recently stressed that the UK faces increasingly hostile activity in cyber - space . We simply cannot afford any degree of complacency in this . There are major criminals operating in this space , as well as some malicious state actors , and some 40 % of companies in the UK reported last year that they had faced some kind of cyber - attack . It is a very important issue that we take seriously . I call the shadow Minister . I congratulate the hon . Member for Widnes and Halewood ( Derek Twigg ) on securing this important urgent question . I welcome the Minister to his new role , although I will never be able to rival his literary quotations . This attack on Jaguar Land Rover is extremely concerning . The impact on that world - leading business , and on its suppliers and workers , has been significant . I hope that the whole House agrees that we must use the full force of the state to crack down on cyber - criminals . I appreciate that the Minister is constrained in what he can say , but when were the Government and the National Cyber Security Centre informed of the attack ? What kind of support are the Government and law enforcement agencies able to offer Jaguar Land Rover ?

This tension is evident through several key points:\n\n1. **Balancing Security and Privacy**: Various speakers address how to protect against cyber threats while maintaining the safety and trust of their constituents. For instance, Home Secretaries discuss the importance of protecting Parliament from foreign interference but also emphasize ensuring that personal data is secure under the government.\n\n2. **Government Surveillance Practices**: There are concerns about government surveillance, with some highlighting specific instances where there were suspicions of misusing or mishandling of personal information, such as in Tory party officials allegedly planning to sell their members' data through \"True Blue\" app.\n\n3. **Protecting Citizens from Malicious Activities**: There is a need for measures like the Online Safety Act 2023 and potential future legislation on child-safe phones and preventing harmful content creation (deepfakes), which seek to protect citizens from online abuse and exploitation while also addressing malicious activities.\n\n4. **Concerns About AI's Potential Risks**: The use of artificial intelligence is discussed both positively for its transformative capabilities but also concerning for how it might threaten democratic processes. This raises questions about the balance between enabling beneficial uses of AI and mitigating its risks to democracy.\n\n5. **Business and Cybersecurity**: There are calls for every company, including public sector organizations, to take cybersecurity seriously, indicating a call to action from the government towards greater awareness and implementation of protective measures across sectors.\n\n6. **Economic Security vs. Privacy Concerns**: Some discussions touch on economic security, with concerns about cyber-attacks impacting businesses like Jaguar Land Rover, which highlights how national security threats can also affect the economy, raising questions about balancing such impacts while safeguarding citizen privacy.\n\nOverall, these speeches reveal a complex interplay between ensuring state and economic security against digital threats versus preserving individual citizens' rights to privacy in an increasingly connected world. The tension lies in striking an appropriate balance where both areas are addressed adequately without compromising one at the expense of the other.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T17:38:12"}

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees runs an extensive scheme in Rwanda , and supports the resettlement of many thousands of migrants . I met some of them in my recent visit to Rwanda .

Will my hon .

I am very happy to congratulate those in the diocese of Gloucester and thank them for the pioneering work that they are doing on housing , and I also thank my hon .

He is right to suggest that what Gloucester is doing has a wider application for others in need of emergency housing , not just asylum seekers and refugees , vitally important though that provision is .

What steps the Church of England is taking to support its parish ministry . Parish ministry is at the very heart of the Church ’ s mission . The Church Commissioners are distributing £1 . 2 billion between 2023 and 2025 to support our mission and ministry . This is a 30 % increase on the previous three - year period , and a significant share of that funding will be distributed through dioceses to strengthen our parishes . What can the Church hierarchy do to remove administrative burdens from the clergy , so they can spend more time in their community spreading the best message ever told : the gospel of Jesus Christ ? I think we all recognise that , in any position of public responsibility , there comes a need for some administrative work , but I very much agree with my hon . Friend that we should be freeing up our clergy and parish staff as much as possible to interact with their parishioners and to spread the good news of Jesus Christ . As someone said , the gospel is good news only if it is not too late . I also note the tremendous work being done in his community by St John the Evangelist in Balby and , indeed , by many other churches in his local area . Last Saturday I was privileged to attend the enthronement of the new Bishop of Lincoln , at which there was a vast array of clergy in all their finery . It was a very grand occasion . Lincoln is a predominantly rural diocese and many of the clergy serve five , six or more parishes . Can my hon . Friend reassure me that the Church will focus on providing more clergy to rural areas ? I am delighted that my hon . Friend was able to attend the consecration of the new Bishop of Lincoln . Consecrations are , indeed , very splendid affairs . My hon . Friend is completely right that the beating heart of the Church of England is what goes on in the parishes .

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees runs an extensive scheme in Rwanda , and supports the resettlement of many thousands of migrants . I met some of them in my recent visit to Rwanda . They are happy and grateful for the generosity and welcome that Rwanda has offered them , which has allowed them to restart their lives .

I am very happy to congratulate those in the diocese of Gloucester and thank them for the pioneering work that they are doing on housing , and I also thank my hon . Friend for the important leadership role he plays locally in respect of that extremely important issue . He is right to suggest that what Gloucester is doing has a wider application for others in need of emergency housing , not just asylum seekers and refugees , vitally important though that provision is . I share his view that the need is urgent , and that we should get on with this and other similar excellent initiatives as quickly as possible . What steps the Church of England is taking to support its parish ministry . Parish ministry is at the very heart of the Church ’ s mission . The Church Commissioners are distributing £1 . 2 billion between 2023 and 2025 to support our mission and ministry . This is a 30 % increase on the previous three - year period , and a significant share of that funding will be distributed through dioceses to strengthen our parishes .

I think we all recognise that , in any position of public responsibility , there comes a need for some administrative work , but I very much agree with my hon . Friend that we should be freeing up our clergy and parish staff as much as possible to interact with their parishioners and to spread the good news of Jesus Christ . As someone said , the gospel is good news only if it is not too late . I also note the tremendous work being done in his community by St John the Evangelist in Balby and , indeed , by many other churches in his local area . Last Saturday I was privileged to attend the enthronement of the new Bishop of Lincoln , at which there was a vast array of clergy in all their finery . It was a very grand occasion .

Friend reassure me that the Church will focus on providing more clergy to rural areas ? I am delighted that my hon . Friend was able to attend the consecration of the new Bishop of Lincoln . Consecrations are , indeed , very splendid affairs . My hon . Friend is completely right that the beating heart of the Church of England is what goes on in the parishes .

We inherited a broken asylum system in absolute chaos from the Tories , with tens of thousands stuck in a system dependent on expensive asylum hotels . We are committed to ending the use of hotels as asylum accommodation as soon as possible and before the end of this Parliament , as part of a controlled , managed and orderly programme . Under the Welsh Labour Government , waiting lists , educational standards and opportunities for young people have all ground to an abrupt halt . It is therefore shocking that the Welsh Labour Government are not prioritising issues that would make a real difference to the people of Wales . Instead , Labour Ministers , supported by Plaid Cymru , are ploughing tens of millions of pounds into their nation of sanctuary policy , which is believed to support services for some illegal immigrants . Does the hon . Lady agree that it is high time her colleagues scrapped this wasteful , non - devolved policy and instead focused their time on lowering NHS waiting times and improving standards ? It sounds like the hon . Member does not agree with welcoming the thousands of Ukrainian refugees that the UK Government ’ s nation of sanctuary has supported . The scheme has been used to welcome Ukrainian families fleeing from Russian aggression . That is a cause that I understood her party supported . I associate myself with the remarks of the leader of Plaid Cymru in paying tribute to Hefin David , my friend and colleague . He was an amazing representative for Wales and a real warrior for those who are neurodivergent or find themselves on the margins of society . I am delighted that Caerphilly is so popular today . It seems that so many people who have either only visited several times , or not visited at all and have only read about it in the press , have become experts about my constituency . I am also pleased that the Minister has raised the plight of Ukrainians who came to Wales to seek sanctuary , running from war , because if there was one downside to the by - election , it was the talk of asylum seekers being bad people — that they are all illegal and that they do not contribute anything . Those who said such things should see the exhibition that was on at Caerphilly council and see what asylum seekers have contributed . What message does the Minister have for those Ukrainians who are still seeking asylum in Wales ? We offer sanctuary for those who desperately need it , and we are proud of that , but we inherited contracts and a broken system from the Conservatives . Hotel use has nearly halved since the last election , and we have removed 30 , 000 people who have no right to be here , ensuring that those who do need to be here have the welcome and support that they need . It is not job done , but work in progress . We can compare that with the 14 years of the Tory Government . I call the shadow Secretary of State . After wantonly scrapping the Rwanda scheme , the Labour Government are now overseeing record - breaking figures of illegal immigrants . It is reported that the scandal is now engulfing north Wales , where more than 200 illegal immigrants have tried to gain entry to the country on ferries from Dublin to Holyhead .

Gazans are stuck in a cruel and irrational Catch - 22 situation : they cannot cross the border to Egypt because they do not have visas , as they cannot get their biometrics registered , but they cannot get their biometrics registered because they cannot get to a visa application centre in Egypt . The Government have the power to waive the requirement for biometrics to be registered , and it is in the Minister ’ s hands to do so . Why won ’ t he ? The hon .

What progress he has made on reducing the number of asylum seekers accommodated in hotels . What progress his Department has made on closing asylum hotels . The Home Office has been clear that the use of hotels is a temporary and short - term measure to ensure that we meet our statutory obligation to accommodate destitute asylum seekers . We have made significant progress in closing over 100 asylum hotels as of the end of March . Our actions mean that there are over 20 , 000 fewer asylum seekers in hotels today compared with six months ago . Does the Minister ’ s ambition extend to closing all the hotels ? My right hon . Friend is absolutely right that the Government ’ s ambition is to close the hotels . We closed 100 by the end of March , and we are working towards closing 150 by May . Fundamentally , the objective is to alter the way in which people are accommodated and to introduce more cost - effective and appropriate approaches , but also to reduce the flow of people coming into this country illegally , which is the very best way of alleviating the pressures . I welcome all the efforts that my hon . Friend is making to deal with and speed up the asylum process . However , will he outline what measures he considers when deciding which hotels to close in each tranche ? My right hon . Friend will recognise that value for money is a critical consideration that informs hotel closure decisions , as are operational deliverability and the notice periods on contracts . It is also about recognising the needs in particular locations and the challenges that these sites present . We have a plan , we are closing hotels , and we will continue to deliver on precisely what we promised . For almost two years , the Sandpiper Hotel in Chesterfield has been used as a hotel for asylum seekers .

The SNP Government is criticized for not accommodating these individuals when they arrive, instead only supporting them financially after arrival.

In Doc 2, it states: \"The Home Secretary and the Government website say that they are satisfied that the provisions of hotels as asylum accommodation do not breach any laws.\" It argues that hotel use is a temporary measure to ensure statutory obligations for destitute asylum seekers.\n\nEthically, speakers argue from both perspectives:\n1. **Pro-Accommodation Arguments:**\n   - The state has an ethical obligation to provide humanitarian aid and support.\n   - Accommodating refugees directly shows moral responsibility without placing the burden solely on subsequent services (like education, healthcare).\n2. **Against-Hotels Arguments:**\n   - Hotels are a temporary measure that do not address root causes of migration.\n   - There is concern about security risks associated with accommodating large numbers in hotels.\n\nIn conclusion, there is tension between short-term accommodation measures like using hotels and long-term sustainable solutions to address the ethical responsibilities towards refugees.

No , no , no — you are going to get my drift . We cannot read out phone numbers . This is not the “ Yellow Pages ” advert .

The Minister clearly thinks that that is a very clever line , but he knows well that Glasgow takes more refugees per head of population than any other local authority in the United Kingdom . The line he is trotting out is simply wrong and it is insulting to all those in Scotland who have opened their homes to Ukrainians , the communities across the country who have welcomed Syrians and the volunteers in the big cities who work with asylum seekers every day , helping them to overcome trauma . If he wants Scotland to do more to welcome refugees , when is he going to devolve the power and the financial levers that would allow us to do so ? For good reason , immigration is a reserved matter , but the statistics I have just read out make the point as clear as can be . The SNP tries its very best to undermine the Government ’ s work to stop the boats , but it refuses to accommodate these people when they arrive , and the costs of its fake humanitarianism are borne by everyone but itself .

It is not the Scottish Government ’ s policy towards immigration , refugees and asylum seekers that has been ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal . If the Minister wants the system to work and he wants the Scottish Government to do their part , he must take more action to clear the backlog , as we have heard ; there must be proper safe and legal rights for people to arrive ; and they must be given the right to work when they get here , because then they can pay for their own accommodation and they will not cost the taxpayer money .

Meanwhile , there is talk about Penally military camp in south - west Wales , which was previously condemned by the Welsh Labour Government .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-10-29.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-10-29.txt"}, {"score": 58.682589266310835, "chunk_id": "debates2024-04-15_F13", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-04-15.txt", "date": "2024-04-15", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Of course , the right of return is fundamental as part of efforts towards a two - state solution , and other factors are at play in responding to the Ukrainian situation . The dynamic is very different , which directly affects the relationship we have with the Ukrainian Government , particularly in respect of the ability to carry out checks on individuals . I call the SNP spokesperson . Gaza Families Reunited ’ s petition for a Palestinian family visa scheme has garnered 100 , 000 signatures , and I hope it will soon be debated in Parliament . Gazans are stuck in a cruel and irrational Catch - 22 situation : they cannot cross the border to Egypt because they do not have visas , as they cannot get their biometrics registered , but they cannot get their biometrics registered because they cannot get to a visa application centre in Egypt . The Government have the power to waive the requirement for biometrics to be registered , and it is in the Minister ’ s hands to do so . Why won ’ t he ? The hon . Lady will appreciate that the security of the system is imperative . We must act in accordance with the requirements , which we put front and centre . I will not comment on ongoing litigation , but I can say that we will continue to work with Foreign Office colleagues in the way that we have described . Elements of the peace process are at play in relation to these issues , but we will keep our response to this crisis under review as matters develop . What progress he has made on reducing the number of asylum seekers accommodated in hotels . What progress his Department has made on closing asylum hotels . The Home Office has been clear that the use of hotels is a temporary and short - term measure to ensure that we meet our statutory obligation to accommodate destitute asylum seekers . We have made significant progress in closing over 100 asylum hotels as of the end of March . Our actions mean that there are over 20 , 000 fewer asylum seekers in hotels today compared with six months ago . Does the Minister ’ s ambition extend to closing all the hotels ? My right hon . Friend is absolutely right that the Government ’ s ambition is to close the hotels . We closed 100 by the end of March , and we are working towards closing 150 by May . Fundamentally , the objective is to alter the way in which people are accommodated and to introduce more cost - effective and appropriate approaches , but also to reduce the flow of people coming into this country illegally , which is the very best way of alleviating the pressures . I welcome all the efforts that my hon . Friend is making to deal with and speed up the asylum process . However , will he outline what measures he considers when deciding which hotels to close in each tranche ? My right hon . Friend will recognise that value for money is a critical consideration that informs hotel closure decisions , as are operational deliverability and the notice periods on contracts . It is also about recognising the needs in particular locations and the challenges that these sites present . We have a plan , we are closing hotels , and we will continue to deliver on precisely what we promised . For almost two years , the Sandpiper Hotel in Chesterfield has been used as a hotel for asylum seekers . The North Derbyshire Refugee Support Group has told me that not a single person who has stayed there has been asked to go back to their country .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-04-15.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-04-15.txt"}, {"score": 58.40511281384175, "chunk_id": "debates2025-07-07_F18", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-07-07.txt", "date": "2025-07-07", "parliament": "UK", "text": "The Mercure hotel in Stanwell in my constituency is used to house asylum seekers , and I have had multiple reports of asylum seekers there working illegally . Will the Department please put that on immigration enforcement ’ s radar , so that it can take the appropriate action ? I assure the hon . Member that we take action against those who break the rules by working illegally . Raids and arrests for illegal working are up 50 % in the last year ; civil penalties in the last quarter were at their highest rate since 2016 ; and we are taking action to close the gig economy loophole through the Border Security , Asylum and Immigration Bill , which he and his Conservative friends voted against . What steps is the Home Office taking to ensure that Palestinian students awarded scholarships to UK universities can obtain visas and travel to the UK to take up their places ? That is an important issue . I am working closely with the Under - Secretary of State for Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Affairs , my hon . Friend the Member for Lincoln ( Mr Falconer ) , and the Israeli , Jordanian and Egyptian authorities to identify safe routes by which British nationals and other eligible people can leave Gaza , or indeed the west bank , and so are able to obtain visas and travel to the UK . I call the Father of the House . The number of small boat crossings is driving people mad and eroding support for the Labour Government , just as it eroded support for the Conservatives . I worry for the Labour Government ; I want them to do better on this , for all our sakes . Have not our French friends got a point about this country being uniquely attractive to illegal asylum seekers ? We do not have identity cards , and we do not do what the Belgians do , which is to refuse to put them in reception centres . Can we make a study of what every other member of the Council of Europe is doing , and replicate the strongest actions , so that this is not the most attractive country for illegal asylum seekers ? I agree with the right hon . Member that we need to take action on a whole range of things . That includes action in France , further action on the network of criminal gangs , action on the water , and action to tackle illegal working and reform the asylum system in the UK . We inherited a system in which there was not enough action on illegal working ; that is why we have ensured a 50 % increase in raids and arrests . We will also bring forward more reforms on asylum . To what extent does the Minister agree that reform of the European convention on human rights , which can block us from deporting some foreign criminals , including paedophiles , should be a priority for the Government ? My hon . Friend is absolutely right that it should be for Parliament and the Government to decide who has a right to remain in our country . As set out in our immigration White Paper , we intend to clarify these issues and the application of article 8 rights in the UK . Less than three weeks ago , the Home Secretary whipped her Back Benchers against new clause 43 to the Crime and Policing Bill , which had cross - party support and would have criminalised the harassment of women and girls . Her Ministers promised at the Dispatch Box and elsewhere that the new clause was not necessary because the matter would be dealt with in the violence against women and girls strategy , which was meant to come out before the recess .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-07-07.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-07-07.txt"}, {"score": 58.031016262521995, "chunk_id": "debates2025-03-25_F30", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-03-25.txt", "date": "2025-03-25", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Will the Minister give a guarantee that pregnant women will not be moved from hotel to hotel , so that they can have continuity of services and a safe pregnancy ? That certainly should not be happening . If my hon . Friend wants to talk to me about it , I will try to see what happened in that instance . A directive from the Treasury reported in The Times appears to suggest that house building by the Government will help with the backlog of asylum seekers staying in hotels . Does the Minister believe that individuals who have arrived in the UK illegally should be given access to social housing ahead of British citizens ? No . Back in 2021 , the Conservatives , when in government , told the town of Blackpool that they would use the Metropole hotel as an asylum hotel for three months . They lost control of the borders and drove the asylum system into chaos , and we are still paying the price now , in one of the most deprived communities in the country . Does the Minister agree that we need to close these hotels as soon as possible and give back that prime real estate — especially in coastal communities such as Blackpool — to help the tourism industry thrive ? We do not believe that it is sustainable to keep hotel use indefinitely , and we are working to close hotels . Small boat crossings are up 30 % since the general election . The number of illegal asylum seekers in the asylum hotel in my constituency of Broxbourne is also up . Illegal asylum seekers are being prioritised for GP appointments and school places , which is outrageous to me and my hard - working constituents . Can the Minister tell the House when she will meet her manifesto commitment of closing the asylum hotel in my constituency of Broxbourne ? Our aim is to close asylum hotels and get out of what we feel is an unsustainable situation as quickly as practicable . I am sure that the Minister agrees that one of the root causes of this crisis was the last Government ’ s politically motivated actions , first slowing down and then freezing the processing of asylum applications . I have asylum seekers waiting 10 or more years for a decision . The British public want to see a contribution by asylum seekers to the system , reducing the public burden on taxpayers , so has the Minister considered lifting the ban on work so that people waiting more than six months for a decision can contribute to our tax system until a decision is made ? Asylum seekers who wait longer than a year are allowed to work , so long as that wait has not been caused by them — that is , a wait through no fault of their own . We have that system now , and I am not considering shortening the length of time that must elapse before work is allowed . rose — Order . Questions are getting considerably longer . Can we keep them on point ? Like the right hon . Member for Herne Bay and Sandwich ( Sir Roger Gale ) , I have visited Calais on a number of occasions , and I have met people there who are desperate . They are victims of war , human rights abuses , environmental degradation and sheer poverty and desperation . They do not cross the channel without a reason to do it . What conversations is the Minister having with those in European countries , north Africa and the middle east about the root causes of the huge numbers of people globally who are seeking asylum at the present time ? Inhumanity and deportation will not work .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-03-25.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-03-25.txt"}, {"score": 57.971553379709086, "chunk_id": "debates2023-11-27_F14", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-11-27.txt", "date": "2023-11-27", "parliament": "UK", "text": "What actions are being taken to address the technical problems contributing to delays in processing BRP applications ? I hope the Home Secretary can answer that question . I am pleased to report to the hon . Lady that that part of our Visas and Immigration service is now operating within its service standard , so there is a good service being offered to members of the public , but if she has any specific cases , she can bring them to my attention . As a local authority closely tied to Heathrow airport , the London Borough of Hillingdon has been doing great work to manage the impact of those currently in the asylum process . That is despite a funding imbalance in national rates , given the local population and the numbers of asylum seekers . Will my right hon . Friend commit to work with me to look at how we can ensure that those authorities , such as Hillingdon Council , linked with major ports of entry are given the resources to cope with such demands ? My hon . Friend raises an important matter for his constituents . As they live in the local authority beside Heathrow airport , it is true that his constituents bear a particular burden with respect to asylum seekers . We do provide £3 , 500 per asylum seeker to a local authority to help meet those costs , but a local authority such as Hillingdon does need our support , and I would be delighted to work with him in that regard . The Home Secretary will be familiar with the invasive surveillance systems that authoritarian states such as Russia and China impose on their citizens . Is he comfortable with the Policing Minister ’ s push for similar live facial recognition systems to be used on innocent Brits , at a time when our colleagues in the European Parliament are legislating to abandon this technology ? We should be clear that retrospective facial recognition puts hundreds , if not thousands , of criminals in prison . For example , it was used to catch a murderer who had killed somebody in a Coventry nightclub who was then identified using an image taken on a mobile phone . That is a murderer who would not be in prison but for the use of retrospective facial recognition . Live facial recognition has been used extensively by two police forces and experimentally by two others , including by South Wales , which has an excellent Labour police and crime commissioner , Alun Michael , who has led the way in this area in a way that is safe and that respects privacy . Critically , if someone ’ s face is scanned and they are not on the wanted list , their details are deleted immediately , which I hope provides reassurance on the questions of privacy . Where it has been used , wanted people , including a wanted rapist and a wanted sex offender , have been apprehended who otherwise would have gone free . I would hope that the entire House can agree that catching wanted rapists is something that we can all get behind . During the recent protests , we have seen politicians hounded out of their offices and even needing a police escort at a train station . What more can we do to ensure that people who make decisions are doing it fairly and not from intimidation ? My hon . Friend makes an excellent point . That is exactly why we are having an emergency meeting of the Defending Democracy Taskforce tomorrow to assess these issues . The incidents that we have seen in this country since 7 October — absolutely hateful incidents — have left some people feeling unable to make the arguments that their constituents would expect them to make because they feel vulnerable or they feel threatened .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-11-27.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-11-27.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2023-07-03.txt | debates2023-07-03_F7 | 2023-07-03 | UK", "debates2023-07-03.txt | debates2023-07-03_F8 | 2023-07-03 | UK", "debates2023-11-16.txt | debates2023-11-16_F15 | 2023-11-16 | UK", "debates2023-11-27.txt | debates2023-11-27_F14 | 2023-11-27 | UK", "debates2024-04-15.txt | debates2024-04-15_F13 | 2024-04-15 | UK", "debates2025-03-25.txt | debates2025-03-25_F30 | 2025-03-25 | UK", "debates2025-07-07.txt | debates2025-07-07_F18 | 2025-07-07 | UK", "debates2025-10-29.txt | debates2025-10-29_F6 | 2025-10-29 | UK"], "answer": "The document discusses various aspects related to refugee and asylum seeker policies but does not provide a direct description of the state's moral responsibility or detailed ethical arguments for or against absorbing refugees. However, I can infer some key points that touch on these themes based on the content:\n\n### Ethical Arguments For Absorbing Refugees:\n1. **Moral Duty**: The document implicitly suggests that there is a moral duty to help those fleeing persecution and war. This is evident in discussions about human rights abuses, environmental degradation, poverty, and other forms of suffering.\n2. **Humanitarian Concerns**: There are references to humanitarian crises such as climate change causing displacement. Ethically, it can be argued that states have a responsibility to alleviate such humanitarian crises and provide shelter for those in need.\n\n### Ethical Arguments Against Absorbing Refugees:\n1. **Resource Allocation**: The document mentions concerns about the public burden on taxpayers. This implies an argument against absorbing refugees based on the idea that resources should be allocated more efficiently, perhaps by helping them elsewhere.\n2. **Economic Impact**: There are discussions of delays in processing applications and housing costs. These could be seen as ethical arguments suggesting that states have a responsibility to manage their own economic stability and fairness.\n\n### State's Moral Responsibility:\nWhile not explicitly stated, the document suggests a state’s moral obligation to protect human rights and mitigate humanitarian crises. It mentions actions like providing social housing, working with local authorities to manage asylum seekers' impact, and supporting police forces in using technology for crime prevention (e.g., facial recognition). These initiatives can be interpreted as steps taken by states to fulfill their ethical obligations.\n\nIn summary, the document leans towards an argument that refugees should generally be absorbed because of moral responsibilities to help those suffering from persecution or crisis situations. However, it also acknowledges potential economic and resource concerns which are presented as reasons for managing rather than completely closing off asylum channels.", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T17:41:31"}

The Scottish Government is accused by some parties of not sufficiently accommodating these individuals upon their arrival, while other parties argue that the responsibility lies with the central UK government.\n\nOn one side, it is proposed that the Scottish Government should take more action to clear backlogs and ensure that refugees have proper safe and legal rights. It's suggested they should be given work permits to help pay for their own accommodation and thus reduce reliance on taxpayer money (Doc 1). Another point of view is highlighted by Doc 2, where it states that Glasgow takes more refugees per head of population than any other local authority in the UK, suggesting a moral duty at the national level. The Home Secretary emphasizes that immigration is reserved as a reserved matter for central government, and thus argues against devolving responsibility to Scotland.\n\nOn the other side, some individuals argue that the state should take more responsibility by not only taking action but also providing proper resources such as housing and employment opportunities (Doc 1). A criticism of the SNP's stance comes from Doc 2, which states that they refuse accommodation, implying a lack of moral or legal obligation to do so.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, arguments can be made both for and against absorbing refugees based on various factors. One argument in favor is presented by Doc 4: ensuring adequate standard of accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers. The Home Secretary highlights the government's efforts through contracts that provide safe, habitable, fit-for-purpose, and correctly equipped accommodations.\n\nAn opposing argument comes from the Solicitor General in Doc 3 regarding violence against women and girls (VAWG), which indicates a focus on providing services rather than accepting or housing refugees due to moral obligations. Another ethical concern raised is by the DWP, who mentions the importance of asylum seekers being given no recourse to public funds for benefits.\n\nIn summary, while there are economic arguments made in favor of absorbing refugees and asylum seekers, such as reducing reliance on public funds (Doc 1), ethical considerations point towards ensuring proper accommodation, employment opportunities, safety measures, and fair treatment.

The UK Government have been delivering work in conjunction with communities to provide sanctuary for those fleeing the most dreadful conflicts around the world , including in Ukraine , Afghanistan and Syria , as well as those fleeing the situation in Hong Kong . She is also right to touch on the abuse of routes , which is precisely why we are introducing greater Care Quality Commission oversight and accreditation of the health and social care visa system . I hear my right hon . Friend ’ s representations on accommodation , on which we have had conversations . Reducing inflow is critical to allowing us to get on with closing hotels across the country , and to getting the accommodation picture into a more manageable state . It is clear that only this Government have a credible plan to reduce the inflow of people coming here illegally via small boats across the channel . We will see that through to make sure that we can get on with closing more hotels . As the policy is rolled out , it is seen to be the brutal and inhumane financial fiasco that it is . Asylum seekers were detained as they turned up for their normal monthly reporting yesterday , causing immense distress . A number of them will inevitably be sent to the detention centres in my constituency . We have experience of what happens when people are distressed in this way . We have seen suicides , self - harm and mental breakdowns . Can I have an assurance from the Minister that the charities that support asylum seekers in detention , including Care4Calais , will have direct access to these detained individuals , and that these individuals will have access to legal advice ? There are , of course , established processes whereby people can access the support that is appropriate in the circumstances . I have a principled disagreement with the right hon .

However , where people are here who have no right to be here , I think it is appropriate that they are detained for the purposes of removal .

As ever , that will continue to be the case during the ongoing work as part of the Rwanda relocations . I welcome the statement and , in particular , the news that in some categories at least immigration is finally beginning to fall . On asylum specifically , the Irish Foreign Minister and former Taoiseach , Micheál Martin , complained bitterly just a few days ago that large numbers of asylum seekers were moving from Northern Ireland into the Irish Republic . Sky News reported yesterday that the Irish Government are seriously contemplating moving police officers to the border to interdict that flow . In effect , that would create a hard border on the island of Ireland . Some of us were lectured for years , including by today ’ s Opposition spokesman , that the Irish Government would never contemplate that in any circumstances , so the stench of hypocrisy is strong . Will the Minister assure me that we will never allow the Republic to return those people to Northern Ireland unless and until we can remove illegal cross - channel migrants to France ?

When it comes to antisocial behaviour , what a grim message this is for some of the most vulnerable in society . Unfortunately — it is incredibly tragic — the Scottish National party ’ s obsession with separatism has led to the highest number of alcohol and drug - related deaths in Europe on their watch . Falling police numbers in Scotland when numbers are rising in England and Wales — that is what the SNP brings us , and only good government from the Conservatives can stop crime and protect victims . What steps her Department is taking to reduce the number of small boats transporting irregular migrants across the English channel . We remain determined to stop the boats and deter people from making these dangerous journeys to the UK , and we are making progress . We have by no means reached the finishing line , but the number of arrivals is 20 % down , the legacy backlog has nearly halved , and the number of Albanian arrivals has fallen by 90 % this year . While Labour proposes to take thousands of illegal migrants from the EU every single year , letting Brussels decide who comes here , we are determined to stop the boats with our Rwanda plan and our Illegal Migration Act 2023 , which Labour opposed . A hotel in my constituency is housing illegal migrants . They receive local NHS dentistry services and hospital access , and , of course , their living costs are met . Constituents write to me pointing out that they do not have access to all those services . What can my right hon . and learned Friend tell them about how soon the use of hotels for illegal migrants will end ? It is totally unacceptable that too many towns and cities around the country now house the 45 , 000 asylum seekers who are in hotels , costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day . That is why we are standing up large sites and vessels around the country . We are also maximising the use of hotels , so that we can open fewer hotels . It is not right that the British taxpayer is forking out the cost . What we are not doing is the ridiculous plan set out by Labour Members . They are either grotesquely naive about the problem or they have a betrayal plan to rejoin the EU . After all , most of them wanted a second referendum . Either way , we can all see it for what it is : a plan for open borders , unlimited migration and rejoining the European Union . It is the same old Labour on the wrong side of the argument . I welcome the shadow Minister , Dan Jarvis . It is good to be back , Mr Speaker . The number of people arriving on dangerous small boats is now 150 times higher than it was five years ago . Meanwhile , convictions of people smugglers are 30 % down . Our border security is not working . The Home Office has already spent £140 million on a flawed Rwanda scheme , but would not taxpayers ’ money be better spent recruiting hundreds more police and investigators to defeat the criminal gang networks and prevent the dangerous boat crossings ? The reality is that we need a robust and honest approach to dealing with this problem . Opening our doors to thousands of migrants from the EU is not the solution . We need a deterrent , and that is why our agreement with Rwanda will work .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-09-18.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-09-18.txt"}, {"score": 0.6292939186096191, "chunk_id": "debates2023-11-27_F6", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-11-27.txt", "date": "2023-11-27", "parliament": "UK", "text": "On 7 October , her five - year - old daughter was in northern Gaza staying with her grandmother .

Friend ’ s community in Chelmsford has been incredibly generous . The UK Government have been delivering work in conjunction with communities to provide sanctuary for those fleeing the most dreadful conflicts around the world , including in Ukraine , Afghanistan and Syria , as well as those fleeing the situation in Hong Kong . She is also right to touch on the abuse of routes , which is precisely why we are introducing greater Care Quality Commission oversight and accreditation of the health and social care visa system . I hear my right hon . Friend ’ s representations on accommodation , on which we have had conversations . Reducing inflow is critical to allowing us to get on with closing hotels across the country , and to getting the accommodation picture into a more manageable state . It is clear that only this Government have a credible plan to reduce the inflow of people coming here illegally via small boats across the channel . We will see that through to make sure that we can get on with closing more hotels . As the policy is rolled out , it is seen to be the brutal and inhumane financial fiasco that it is . Asylum seekers were detained as they turned up for their normal monthly reporting yesterday , causing immense distress . A number of them will inevitably be sent to the detention centres in my constituency . We have experience of what happens when people are distressed in this way . We have seen suicides , self - harm and mental breakdowns . Can I have an assurance from the Minister that the charities that support asylum seekers in detention , including Care4Calais , will have direct access to these detained individuals , and that these individuals will have access to legal advice ? There are , of course , established processes whereby people can access the support that is appropriate in the circumstances . I have a principled disagreement with the right hon .

However , where people are here who have no right to be here , I think it is appropriate that they are detained for the purposes of removal .

I welcome the statement and , in particular , the news that in some categories at least immigration is finally beginning to fall . On asylum specifically , the Irish Foreign Minister and former Taoiseach , Micheál Martin , complained bitterly just a few days ago that large numbers of asylum seekers were moving from Northern Ireland into the Irish Republic . Sky News reported yesterday that the Irish Government are seriously contemplating moving police officers to the border to interdict that flow . In effect , that would create a hard border on the island of Ireland . Some of us were lectured for years , including by today ’ s Opposition spokesman , that the Irish Government would never contemplate that in any circumstances , so the stench of hypocrisy is strong . Will the Minister assure me that we will never allow the Republic to return those people to Northern Ireland unless and until we can remove illegal cross - channel migrants to France ?

Falling police numbers in Scotland when numbers are rising in England and Wales — that is what the SNP brings us , and only good government from the Conservatives can stop crime and protect victims . What steps her Department is taking to reduce the number of small boats transporting irregular migrants across the English channel . We remain determined to stop the boats and deter people from making these dangerous journeys to the UK , and we are making progress . We have by no means reached the finishing line , but the number of arrivals is 20 % down , the legacy backlog has nearly halved , and the number of Albanian arrivals has fallen by 90 % this year . While Labour proposes to take thousands of illegal migrants from the EU every single year , letting Brussels decide who comes here , we are determined to stop the boats with our Rwanda plan and our Illegal Migration Act 2023 , which Labour opposed . A hotel in my constituency is housing illegal migrants . They receive local NHS dentistry services and hospital access , and , of course , their living costs are met .

It is totally unacceptable that too many towns and cities around the country now house the 45 , 000 asylum seekers who are in hotels , costing the British taxpayer £6 million a day . That is why we are standing up large sites and vessels around the country . We are also maximising the use of hotels , so that we can open fewer hotels . It is not right that the British taxpayer is forking out the cost . What we are not doing is the ridiculous plan set out by Labour Members . They are either grotesquely naive about the problem or they have a betrayal plan to rejoin the EU . After all , most of them wanted a second referendum . Either way , we can all see it for what it is : a plan for open borders , unlimited migration and rejoining the European Union . It is the same old Labour on the wrong side of the argument . I welcome the shadow Minister , Dan Jarvis . It is good to be back , Mr Speaker . The number of people arriving on dangerous small boats is now 150 times higher than it was five years ago . Meanwhile , convictions of people smugglers are 30 % down . Our border security is not working . The Home Office has already spent £140 million on a flawed Rwanda scheme , but would not taxpayers ’ money be better spent recruiting hundreds more police and investigators to defeat the criminal gang networks and prevent the dangerous boat crossings ? The reality is that we need a robust and honest approach to dealing with this problem . Opening our doors to thousands of migrants from the EU is not the solution .

At the heart of the reforms will be a complete overhaul of the appeals system — the biggest obstacle to reducing the size of the asylum system and ending hotel use . Tens of thousands of people in asylum accommodation are currently waiting for appeals , and under the current system that figure is to grow , with an average wait time already of 54 weeks . We have already funded thousands of additional sitting days this year , and the border security Bill will introduce a statutory timeframe of 24 weeks . However , we need to go further . We will introduce a new independent body to deal with immigration and asylum appeals . It will be fully independent of Government and staffed by professionally trained adjudicators , with safeguards to ensure high standards . It will be able to surge capacity as needed and to accelerate and prioritise cases , alongside new procedures to tackle repeat applications and unnecessary delays . We are also increasing detention and returns capacity , including a 1 , 000 - bed expansion at Campsfield and Haslar , with the first tranche of additional beds coming online within months to support many thousands more enforced removals each year . Our reforms will also address the overly complex system for family migration , including changes to the way that article 8 of the ECHR is interpreted . We should be clear that international law is important . It is because other countries know that we abide by international law that we have been able to make new agreements with France , to return people who arrive on small boats , and with Germany , to stop the warehousing of small boats by criminal gangs , and it is why we have been able to explore return hubs partnerships with other European countries . However , we need the interpretation of international law to keep up with the realities and challenges of today ’ s world . There is one area where we need to make more immediate changes . The current rules for family reunion for refugees were designed many years ago to help families separated by war , conflict and persecution , but the way they are used has now changed . Even just before the pandemic , refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average more than one or two years after they had been granted protection , which was long enough for them to get jobs , find housing and be able to provide their family with some support . In Denmark and Switzerland , those who are granted humanitarian protection are currently not able to apply to bring family for at least two years after protection has been granted . However , in the UK those family applications now come in , on average , around a month after protection has been granted , often even before a newly granted refugee has left asylum accommodation . As a consequence , refugee families who arrive are far more likely to seek homelessness assistance . Some councils are finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion . That is not sustainable . Currently , there are also no conditions on family reunion for refugee sponsors , unlike those in place if the sponsor is a British citizen or long - term UK resident . That is not fair . The proportion of migrants who have arrived on small boats and then applied to bring family has also increased sharply in recent years , with signs that smuggler gangs are now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journeys to the UK .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-01.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-01.txt"}, {"score": 0.6228245496749878, "chunk_id": "debates2025-09-01_F23", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-09-01.txt", "date": "2025-09-01", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Currently , there are also no conditions on family reunion for refugee sponsors , unlike those in place if the sponsor is a British citizen or long - term UK resident . That is not fair . The proportion of migrants who have arrived on small boats and then applied to bring family has also increased sharply in recent years , with signs that smuggler gangs are now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journeys to the UK . We continue to believe that families staying together is important , which is why we will seek to prioritise family groups among the applicants to come to Britain under our new deal with France , but reforms are needed . So in our asylum policy statement later this year , we will set out a new system for family migration , including looking at contribution requirements , longer periods before newly granted refugees can apply , and dedicated controlled arrangements for unaccompanied children and those fleeing persecution who have family in the UK . We aim to have some of those changes in place for the spring , but in the meantime we do need to address the immediate pressures on local authorities and the risks from criminal gangs using family reunion as a pull factor to encourage more people on to dangerous boats . Therefore , this week we are bringing forward new immigration rules to temporarily suspend new applications under the existing dedicated refugee family reunion route . Until the new framework is introduced , refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else . Let me turn next to the action we are taking to ensure that every asylum hotel will be closed for good under this Government , not just by shifting individuals from hotels to other sites but by driving down the numbers in supported accommodation overall , and not in a chaotic way through piecemeal court judgments , but through a controlled , managed and orderly programme : driving down inflow into the asylum system , clearing the appeals backlog , which is crucial , and continuing to increase returns . Within the asylum estate , we are reconfiguring sites , increasing room sharing , tightening the test for accommodation and working at pace to identify alternative , cheaper and more appropriate accommodation with other Departments and with local authorities . We are increasing standards and security and joint public safety co - operation between the police , accommodation providers and the Home Office to ensure that laws and rules are enforced . I understand and agree with local councils and communities who want the asylum hotels in their communities closed , because we need to close all asylum hotels — we need to do so for good — but that must be done in a controlled and orderly manner , not through a return to the previous Government ’ s chaos that led to the opening of hotels in the first place . Finally , let me update the House on the continued legal and controlled support that we will provide for those facing conflict and persecution . We will continue to do our bit to support Ukraine , extending the Ukraine permission extension scheme by a further 24 months , with further details to be set out in due course . We are also taking immediate action to rescue children who have been seriously injured in the horrendous onslaught on civilians in Gaza so that they can get the health treatment they need . The Foreign Secretary will update the House shortly on the progress to get those children out . I confirm that the Home Office has put in place systems to issue expedited visas with biometric checks conducted prior to arrival for children and their immediate accompanying family members .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-01.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-01.txt"}], "sources_unique": ["debates2023-09-18.txt | debates2023-09-18_F14 | 2023-09-18 | UK", "debates2023-11-27.txt | debates2023-11-27_F6 | 2023-11-27 | UK", "debates2024-05-01.txt | debates2024-05-01_F28 | 2024-05-01 | UK", "debates2025-09-01.txt | debates2025-09-01_F22 | 2025-09-01 | UK", "debates2025-09-01.txt | debates2025-09-01_F23 | 2025-09-01 | UK"], "answer": "The document does not contain a detailed description of the state's moral responsibility towards refugees and asylum seekers or the specific ethical arguments presented regarding whether they should be absorbed into society.

At the heart of the reforms will be a complete overhaul of the appeals system — the biggest obstacle to reducing the size of the asylum system and ending hotel use . Tens of thousands of people in asylum accommodation are currently waiting for appeals , and under the current system that figure is to grow , with an average wait time already of 54 weeks . We have already funded thousands of additional sitting days this year , and the border security Bill will introduce a statutory timeframe of 24 weeks . However , we need to go further . We will introduce a new independent body to deal with immigration and asylum appeals . It will be fully independent of Government and staffed by professionally trained adjudicators , with safeguards to ensure high standards . It will be able to surge capacity as needed and to accelerate and prioritise cases , alongside new procedures to tackle repeat applications and unnecessary delays . We are also increasing detention and returns capacity , including a 1 , 000 - bed expansion at Campsfield and Haslar , with the first tranche of additional beds coming online within months to support many thousands more enforced removals each year . Our reforms will also address the overly complex system for family migration , including changes to the way that article 8 of the ECHR is interpreted . We should be clear that international law is important . It is because other countries know that we abide by international law that we have been able to make new agreements with France , to return people who arrive on small boats , and with Germany , to stop the warehousing of small boats by criminal gangs , and it is why we have been able to explore return hubs partnerships with other European countries . However , we need the interpretation of international law to keep up with the realities and challenges of today ’ s world . There is one area where we need to make more immediate changes . The current rules for family reunion for refugees were designed many years ago to help families separated by war , conflict and persecution , but the way they are used has now changed . Even just before the pandemic , refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average more than one or two years after they had been granted protection , which was long enough for them to get jobs , find housing and be able to provide their family with some support . In Denmark and Switzerland , those who are granted humanitarian protection are currently not able to apply to bring family for at least two years after protection has been granted . However , in the UK those family applications now come in , on average , around a month after protection has been granted , often even before a newly granted refugee has left asylum accommodation . As a consequence , refugee families who arrive are far more likely to seek homelessness assistance . Some councils are finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion . That is not sustainable . Currently , there are also no conditions on family reunion for refugee sponsors , unlike those in place if the sponsor is a British citizen or long - term UK resident . That is not fair . The proportion of migrants who have arrived on small boats and then applied to bring family has also increased sharply in recent years , with signs that smuggler gangs are now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journeys to the UK .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-01.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-01.txt"}, {"score": 0.6228245496749878, "chunk_id": "debates2025-09-01_F23", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-09-01.txt", "date": "2025-09-01", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Currently , there are also no conditions on family reunion for refugee sponsors , unlike those in place if the sponsor is a British citizen or long - term UK resident . That is not fair . The proportion of migrants who have arrived on small boats and then applied to bring family has also increased sharply in recent years , with signs that smuggler gangs are now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journeys to the UK . We continue to believe that families staying together is important , which is why we will seek to prioritise family groups among the applicants to come to Britain under our new deal with France , but reforms are needed . So in our asylum policy statement later this year , we will set out a new system for family migration , including looking at contribution requirements , longer periods before newly granted refugees can apply , and dedicated controlled arrangements for unaccompanied children and those fleeing persecution who have family in the UK . We aim to have some of those changes in place for the spring , but in the meantime we do need to address the immediate pressures on local authorities and the risks from criminal gangs using family reunion as a pull factor to encourage more people on to dangerous boats . Therefore , this week we are bringing forward new immigration rules to temporarily suspend new applications under the existing dedicated refugee family reunion route . Until the new framework is introduced , refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else . Let me turn next to the action we are taking to ensure that every asylum hotel will be closed for good under this Government , not just by shifting individuals from hotels to other sites but by driving down the numbers in supported accommodation overall , and not in a chaotic way through piecemeal court judgments , but through a controlled , managed and orderly programme : driving down inflow into the asylum system , clearing the appeals backlog , which is crucial , and continuing to increase returns . Within the asylum estate , we are reconfiguring sites , increasing room sharing , tightening the test for accommodation and working at pace to identify alternative , cheaper and more appropriate accommodation with other Departments and with local authorities . We are increasing standards and security and joint public safety co - operation between the police , accommodation providers and the Home Office to ensure that laws and rules are enforced . I understand and agree with local councils and communities who want the asylum hotels in their communities closed , because we need to close all asylum hotels — we need to do so for good — but that must be done in a controlled and orderly manner , not through a return to the previous Government ’ s chaos that led to the opening of hotels in the first place . Finally , let me update the House on the continued legal and controlled support that we will provide for those facing conflict and persecution . We will continue to do our bit to support Ukraine , extending the Ukraine permission extension scheme by a further 24 months , with further details to be set out in due course . We are also taking immediate action to rescue children who have been seriously injured in the horrendous onslaught on civilians in Gaza so that they can get the health treatment they need . The Foreign Secretary will update the House shortly on the progress to get those children out . I confirm that the Home Office has put in place systems to issue expedited visas with biometric checks conducted prior to arrival for children and their immediate accompanying family members .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-09-01.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-09-01.txt"}, {"score": 0.6194618344306946, "chunk_id": "debates2024-01-15_F1", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-01-15.txt", "date": "2024-01-15", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Although I cannot make commitments about the specific hotels in my hon . Friend ’ s constituency , he should rest assured that we are seeking to drive down the number of hotels on which we rely . My constituent arrived in the UK 15 months ago and was interviewed , but has been waiting for more than a year to receive a final response . He is not alone : according to the Refugee Council , 33 , 085 asylum cases have been lodged in the last six months alone , putting ever more strain on a broken system . The Home Secretary said that the legacy backlog was going down , but what about those more recent cases ? What is being done to deal with them ? The improved processes and the increased number of Home Office officials working on this issue mean that not only the legacy cases but the current ones will be dealt with more quickly , which will reduce the need for asylum accommodation of all types . I cannot comment on individual cases because the circumstances are different in each one , but the hon . Lady should rest assured that the lessons we have learned about the increased speed of processing will benefit those who are already in the system . Of course , we are also determined to drive down the number of people who come here in the first place , reducing the pressure on our asylum processing system in doing so . I call the shadow Minister . The shambolic incompetence of this Government across every aspect of its disgraceful mismanagement of our country ’ s asylum system knows no bounds , but today I will highlight a particularly egregious example . We already knew that the number of removals of asylum seekers whose claims had been rejected had collapsed by 50 % since Labour left office in 2010 , but over the weekend it emerged that the Home Office had lost contact with an astonishing 85 % of the 5 , 000 people who have been identified for removal to Rwanda . Where on earth are those 4 , 250 asylum seekers who have gone missing ? Will the Home Secretary drop all the smoke and mirrors and acknowledge that the Rwanda plan is just an extortionately expensive and unworkable distraction ? When will he adopt Labour ’ s plan to recruit 1 , 000 additional immigration enforcement officers to a new returns unit , so that we can have a system that is based on common sense — Order . Thank you , Mr Speaker . No , it is not “ thank you ” . I have to get a lot of people in and this is totally unfair . The question was very , very long , and I was coughing to get the hon . Gentleman to stop , not to continue . That is the signal we need to understand . If the hon . Gentleman does not want a particular Back Bencher to get in , I ask him please to point them out , because this is giving me that problem . The mask has slipped . The Labour party has said that even if the Rwanda scheme were to be successful , it would not keep it . That shows what Labour Members really think about this . They have no plan , they have no commitment , and they have even said that if something was working they would scrap it . [ Interruption . ] What steps he is taking to help reduce levels of fraud . Apologies for my hesitation , Mr Speaker . I was so busy listening to the heckling opposite that it was difficult to focus on what was going on .

I call the shadow Minister . I thank the Minister for advance sight of his statement , but I have to say that this really is getting quite difficult to watch . Not for the first time , the Minister has come to the Dispatch Box desperately fishing for compliments , when it is his Government , his Home Secretary and his Prime Minister who are the cause of the catastrophic state of both the work - based migration and asylum systems . This is their bin fire — their chaos — yet they expect praise each time they half - heartedly attempt to throw a single teacup of water towards the flames . Net migration has trebled since 2019 to a barely comprehensible 745 , 000 . Under this Government , the number of people crossing in small boats has spiralled from a few hundred in 2018 to tens of thousands every year . It was toe - curlingly embarrassing to watch the Minister claim that he has made “ solid progress ” on stopping the boats , when this year the number of crossers is at the highest level on record — more than 7 , 000 between January and April . It was excruciatingly painful to watch the Home Secretary boast on social media about removing people with no right to be here , when the removal of failed asylum seekers has collapsed by 44 % under this Government since 2010 , when the removal of foreign criminals has plummeted by 27 % , and when he has completely lost track of the 3 , 500 asylum seekers he claims have been identified for deportation to Rwanda . It is also painful to hear Government figures bragging in the media that their Rwanda policy is somehow a success because a single person , who did not even cross the channel on a small boat , has chosen to fly to Rwanda voluntarily , with thousands of pounds of Government money stuffed into his pocket by the Home Secretary . This is not a policy ; it is a headline - chasing gimmick , a fiasco and a farce . Labour has been absolutely clear that we reject the £500 million Rwanda scheme , based on its unaffordability and unworkability . It will cover only 1 % of small - boat asylum seekers , and the Government have no plan for the other 99 % . We will repurpose that money to smash the criminal smuggler gangs with our new cross - border police unit and a security partnership with Europol . Crucially , our new returns and enforcement unit will ensure that more flights take off to other countries , which will remove foreign criminals , failed asylum seekers and visa overstayers so that we can restore some control and integrity to our asylum system in a way that is firm , fair and well managed . We will also end the use of 250 asylum hotels and other inappropriate accommodation for asylum seekers , which is costing the British taxpayer millions of pounds every single day . It is painful to hear the Minister bragging today about the reduction in the number of health and social care visas awarded as a way of bringing down net migration — first , because it is based on such a small data sample ; secondly , because this is only one sector of the economy ; and , thirdly , because the Minister seems to care not one iota what the reduction in workers will mean for our elderly parents . Where is the impact assessment , and where is the plan to recruit local talent ? Can the Minister explain why net migration has trebled since his party pledged during the 2019 general election to lower it ?", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-05-01.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-05-01.txt"}, {"score": 0.6095415949821472, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-25_F16", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-25.txt", "date": "2024-11-25", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Friend makes an important point . There is a serious problem of injunctions , non - molestation orders and protection orders not being treated properly . That is why we are introducing Raneem ’ s law , which includes stronger protection orders and specialists in 999 control rooms . Chelmsford ’ s allocation of dispersal accommodation for asylum seekers is more than 120 beds , but the number found to date is about a tenth of that number owing to the high demand for and high cost of private rented accommodation in the district . What extra support can the Minister offer councils facing the increasing cost of housing asylum seekers ? We are trying to co - operate much more with local authorities so that we can deal with these issues , but ultimately the way to deal with them is to get the backlog down and get people out of high - price accommodation so that we can integrate them if they are granted asylum . I have met a number of British - Palestinian families who are trying to reunite with their families in Gaza . Part of the entry clearance process requires the undertaking of biometrics . There is no visa centre in Gaza , and they are unable to leave owing to the closure of the Rafah crossing . Will the Home Secretary , or the Minister , please indicate whether they are willing to introduce a temporary waiver for biometrics so that people can complete the entry clearance process ? The death and destruction in Gaza are intolerable . Palestinians who wish to join family members in the UK must do so via the range of existing routes that are available , but if my hon . Friend wishes to raise a specific matter with me , I shall be happy to meet her . What steps is the Minister taking to tackle crime in rural areas ? As I said earlier , I have met representatives of the Agricultural Engineers Association to discuss the implementation of the secondary legislation that is required to deal with the theft of agricultural equipment , and I am also having meetings with the rural crime units to discuss some of the specifics . However , the neighbourhood policing guarantee applies in rural areas just as much as in urban areas , which is important . My constituent Tracy set up the organisation Changes Are Made in memory of her grandson Cameron Hamilton , who was fatally stabbed in Bournemouth town centre last year . Tracy believes deeply in the power of education and positive activities to tackle knife crime , and is campaigning for a youth hub in the constituency . Can the Home Secretary update us on the progress being made towards the roll - out of a network of youth hubs , and will she support Tracy ’ s campaign ? I pay tribute to my hon . Friend ’ s constituent Tracy for campaigning in memory of Cameron . Too many young lives are being lost . That is why we are setting up the Young Futures programme , with youth hubs but also prevention partnerships , to work across the country . In recent weeks , the number of channel crossings has been far higher than the Home Office expected , which is why we have seen Ministers rapidly approving new asylum hotels . We are told that the situation is temporary , because asylum claims are apparently now being processed faster and people are being moved through accommodation faster too . What reassurances can the Home Secretary give my constituents that the faster processing of asylum claims , with no deterrent in the system , will not simply act as a massive incentive for more people to come here on small boats ?

This perspective can be seen in various documents, where ministers argue that genuine asylum seekers who have been granted refugee or humanitarian protection status should be welcomed. For instance, in [Doc 1] (source: debates2025-10-13.txt | debates2025-10-13_P2_C2 | 2025-10-13 | UK), the Labour Government argues that people have a history of providing sanctuary, citing an example from their previous Conservative predecessors. They emphasize the importance of genuine asylum seekers rather than economic migrants.\n\nThe ethical arguments for absorbing refugees and asylum seekers are rooted in moral obligations to help those who are fleeing persecution or conflict, which is seen as inherently wrong to exclude them. This perspective can be observed in [Doc 1] where ministers claim that failing to provide sanctuary to genuine asylum seekers represents a failure of their party. They argue against the idea presented by some individuals, suggesting it reflects hypocrisy given past positions.\n\nOn the other hand, ethical arguments against absorbing refugees and asylum seekers are framed around concerns regarding the financial burden on public services. Document [Doc 2] (source: debates2023-07-03.txt | debates2023-07-03_P5_C1 | 2023-07-03 | UK) presents this argument by highlighting the cost to councils from supporting local communities and public services with the influx of asylum seekers. They suggest that providing sanctuary leads to additional financial strain, which can be seen as a moral issue.\n\nIn [Doc 5] (source: debates2025-09-01.txt | debates2025-09-01_P13_C3 | 2025-09-01 | UK), the Government mentions that despite these arguments, people across the country have a history of rejecting exclusionary policies and expressing support for helping refugees. This perspective suggests that while there may be economic concerns, moral obligations to help those in need also exist.\n\nThe state's policy towards Rwanda can be seen as an attempt to resolve some ethical dilemmas surrounding the influx of asylum seekers by implementing more efficient processing systems and faster removals. However, it is still criticized for potentially undermining traditional moral obligations, as evidenced in [Doc 3] (source: debates2023-11-27.txt | debates2023-11-27_P1_C3 | 2023-11-27 | UK).", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T17:44:40"}

There are two states of being on offer today . I have to break some news to Members : whatever happens to the Bill today , people with a terminal illness will still take their lives .

Improvements also go hand in hand ; medics from across the world told us that the two things are complementary . In Australia I discussed this issue with a palliative care doctor who was against the introduction of assisted dying when they were contemplating it . She now finds it an invaluable tool , and she embraces it as something that her patients want and need . My concern is that if the Bill is turned down , as it was in 2015 , the conversation about palliative care will wither , as it has done for the past 10 years . I want to share a story that has particularly affected me . Mark Crampton was a former police chief inspector who was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .

There are two states of being on offer today . I have to break some news to Members : whatever happens to the Bill today , people with a terminal illness will still take their lives . If the Bill falls today , we will be consigning those people to taking their lives in brutal , violent ways , as they are at the moment , and will see increasing numbers of our fellow citizens making the trip to Switzerland if they can afford it . We know that between 600 and 700 people a year are killing themselves in violent ways — shooting themselves , throwing themselves in front of trains , taking overdoses in lonely , horrible circumstances .

The evidence from the Health and Care Committee , published only in February this year , shows that palliative care and assisted dying go hand in hand . rose — I will not give way . Improvements also go hand in hand ; medics from across the world told us that the two things are complementary . In Australia I discussed this issue with a palliative care doctor who was against the introduction of assisted dying when they were contemplating it . She now finds it an invaluable tool , and she embraces it as something that her patients want and need . My concern is that if the Bill is turned down , as it was in 2015 , the conversation about palliative care will wither , as it has done for the past 10 years . I want to share a story that has particularly affected me . Mark Crampton was a former police chief inspector who was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . His COPD became too much for him , so he informed his family that he was going to take his own life . He took his oxygen tank and mask and late one night went out and sat on a railway embankment .

None the less , on social care , I very sincerely and warmly welcome the Conservative party ’ s support for the independent commission . It is important , as a matter of principle , to try to establish in broad terms the level of consensus about what social care should look like and how it should be delivered to meet the needs of older and disabled people in the 21st century , with changing demography , changing challenges , changing pressures and a changing pace of technology , and about the balance of provision between the individual , the family and the state , and the balance of financial contributions for social care between the individual , the family and the state . Of course , those issues will inevitably be contested across the party political divide from one election to the next , but just as we have had broad consensus on the national health service since 1948 , just as we have had broad consensus on state education since Rab Butler ’ s reforms , and just as we have mostly had broad consensus for much of the past century on how public services should be delivered , so too should we try to establish the same consensus on social care . That is not to say that we should agree on everything , but we should agree on as much as possible , because whether it was Gordon Brown and Andy Burnham in 2010 or Theresa May in 2017 , we can see the extent to which party political wrangling , rancour and sometimes opportunism has sunk well - meaning attempts to grasp the nettle of reform . On the question of pace , I reassure people that in our first six months we have already legislated for fair pay agreements , delivered the biggest expansion of carer ’ s allowance since the 1970s , and immediately injected £86 million into the disabled facilities grant , with another £86 million to follow from April — £711 million in total over the next year — as well as the increased spending power for local government in the Budget and £880 million for social care specifically . With respect to the people who are saying , “ Go faster ” , I urge them to bear in mind that we have already done quite a lot in six months . We do not pretend that we have solved all the problems — we have not nearly solved all the problems — but that is not a bad start for a Government who are determined to show that we understand the pressures in social care today and are willing to deliver . The Dilnot proposals were very good technical responses to a question that Andrew Dilnot was set by David Cameron , but we should reflect on why it was that every single Prime Minister since Lord Cameron , including Lord Cameron himself , did not implement those reforms . There has always been something else in health and social care that has been more pressing and urgent . I am sure that Baroness Casey will consider the Dilnot proposals alongside all the other challenges and potential solutions to the wider issues in social care , but we are determined to respond at pace . That is why the first phase of the Casey commission will report next year , setting out an action plan throughout this Parliament . I hope that we can achieve broad consensus on those actions too .

Let me be clear : we on the Conservative Benches want a pensions industry that is investing in growing UK businesses , infrastructure , housing and all those elements that drive a healthier economy , but it also has to be for the benefit of savers . Of course , the risks in this case would be borne entirely by private sector workers , while public sector workers would be protected . Finally , we are clear that pension savings should never be there to dig a Chancellor out of the economic hole that she has made . I will directly address two questions and then come to the overall tone of the shadow Chancellor ’ s remarks . There has been a debate across this House and in the wider industry about mandation , including on UK equities . It has been led by Conservative peers in the House of Lords — Baroness Altmann has called for exactly that — and by some Members in this House , including the right hon . Member for Salisbury ( John Glen ) on the Conservative Benches . What we are setting out a voluntary agreement led by the industry . On the industry consensus behind the accord , 90 % of the defined contribution industry , by active savers , have signed up this morning — and all providers , including those that did not sign up today , are committed to the idea of more investment in private assets . More generally , the shadow Chancellor ’ s tone is disappointing . The truth is that he is a lonely figure . There is a wide consensus about the direction of travel to invest more in private assets , as Canadian and Australian pension funds do , and today ’ s accord is industry led ; it sets benchmarks agreed by the industry , and in fact many industry players want to go further . There should be cross - party consensus . At the event this morning , the Chancellor spelt out that this work builds on the work of her predecessor in supporting the 2023 Mansion House compact . The shadow Chancellor will remember that compact because it was signed under a Conservative Government when he was the Work and Pensions Secretary — he was in the press release , championing it . He was right then , and he is letting himself down now . I have some news : a response to the accord has just come in from Guy Opperman . Hon . Members will remember him , because he was the Conservative former Member for Hexham and the only Pensions Minister in the last Government to last more than five minutes ; he was in post for five years . What did he say about this morning ’ s accord ? He said that it is a “ good thing ” and “ should be welcomed ” — he is not wrong . I call the Chair of the Select Committee . I draw attention to my entry in the Register of Members ’ Financial Interests as a trustee of the parliamentary contributory pension fund . The points about fiduciary duty have been made . Given that fund managers will need time to pool together funds that reflect the Government ’ s wishes and the voluntary accord , when does the Minister expect it to kick in ? At that point , might he consider mandation ? The decision by the industry , reflecting the question that the Chair of the Select Committee raises about pace of change , is that the targets for asset allocation are for 2030 .

Those on the Government side of the House have been pulling their weight , even in Opposition day debates — in debates on school safety and animal welfare , for example , there were more Conservative speakers than Opposition speakers . Let me go into the specific points that the hon . Lady raised . On tents , the Home Secretary has no plans to ban Millets — we are not doing that . The Government have made the largest investment ever in tackling homelessness and rough sleeping , providing £2 billion to accelerate its mitigation and prevention , including preventing 640 , 000 people from becoming homeless in the last five years . On conversion therapy , we have a manifesto commitment , and it is still a manifesto commitment . The Secretary of State will keep the House informed on the work she is doing on this important matter . I was surprised to hear the hon . Lady raise nutrient neutrality . I had hoped she would support our measures , but the Secretary of State will no doubt update the House on the further work he is doing in that area .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-11-09.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-11-09.txt"}, {"score": 37.45525622718097, "chunk_id": "debates2025-03-18_F4", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-03-18.txt", "date": "2025-03-18", "parliament": "UK", "text": "The bottom line on all of this is that the leader of the hon . Member ’ s party earlier today moved away from the commitments that she had made on net zero . Just a few years ago , she said that “ Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine has made it clear that relying on authoritarian regimes ” can make it “ harder…to heat our homes ” . They recognised then the importance of this net zero transition ; now they are running away from how we deliver on it . I call the Chair of the Select Committee , Bill Esterson . UK electricity bills are the highest in Europe compared to gas . Evidence given to the Select Committee suggests that the Government are absolutely right to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels , and it is a shame that some Opposition Members have abandoned an evidence - informed approach to policymaking . Can the Minister confirm whether the Government are considering rebalancing the infrastructure levies on our energy bills , as a way of reducing electricity bills in the immediate future and as a down payment towards 2030 and beyond ? The Select Committee Chair makes an important point . Along with the Minister for Energy Consumers , my hon . Friend the Member for Peckham ( Miatta Fahnbulleh ) , I am looking at all options , because it is important that we bring down bills and that we are building an energy system that protects us from the volatile fossil fuel markets in the future . There are trade - offs to be made when rebalancing that we need to be aware of , in particular whether a diminishing number of gas customers can pay bills if we were to transfer levies , but we are looking at all options and are , of course , looking at how we review with Ofgem the wider question of standing charges to make sure we bring down bills . My hon . Friend is right to say of the journey that we are on — and that the Conservative party used to be on , and on which there used to be consensus — that our transition to net zero is important for energy security and for the climate , but also for protecting bills in the long term . The Minister is clearly aware of the foolhardy decision by the Opposition to abandon the political consensus on net zero , but has he made an assessment of the cost to the consumer of pursuing that disastrous path , which would lock us into our dependence on polluting fossil fuels , volatile oil and gas prices , and the whims of foreign dictators ? My hon . Friend is absolutely right . It is important to recognise that where once there was consensus in this country on how we tackle the climate crisis and , crucially , how we deliver the economic and industrial advantage , that consensus seems to have been splintered by the Conservative party . It was only two years ago that the leader of that party made an important point , which I agree with strongly , when she said “ if we get our strategy wrong , we risk being left on the backfoot as other countries seize the advantage . ” The Conservative party now wishes us to be on the backfoot , but we are determined that we will drive forward because that is the best policy for consumers , economic growth and energy security . I call the shadow Minister . The Government ’ s rush to decarbonise the grid means more hidden costs , more curtailment payments , more balancing payments , more subsidies and a higher carbon price . Will the Minister guarantee that our carbon price will remain lower than the European price for the remainder of this Parliament ?", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-03-18.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-03-18.txt"}, {"score": 37.18988554839336, "chunk_id": "debates2025-01-06_F26", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-01-06.txt", "date": "2025-01-06", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Honestly , their contributions to discussions in this House might have more credibility and a stronger landing zone if they at least acknowledged their part in the deep mess and malaise that they have created over the past 14 years . None the less , on social care , I very sincerely and warmly welcome the Conservative party ’ s support for the independent commission . It is important , as a matter of principle , to try to establish in broad terms the level of consensus about what social care should look like and how it should be delivered to meet the needs of older and disabled people in the 21st century , with changing demography , changing challenges , changing pressures and a changing pace of technology , and about the balance of provision between the individual , the family and the state , and the balance of financial contributions for social care between the individual , the family and the state . Of course , those issues will inevitably be contested across the party political divide from one election to the next , but just as we have had broad consensus on the national health service since 1948 , just as we have had broad consensus on state education since Rab Butler ’ s reforms , and just as we have mostly had broad consensus for much of the past century on how public services should be delivered , so too should we try to establish the same consensus on social care . That is not to say that we should agree on everything , but we should agree on as much as possible , because whether it was Gordon Brown and Andy Burnham in 2010 or Theresa May in 2017 , we can see the extent to which party political wrangling , rancour and sometimes opportunism has sunk well - meaning attempts to grasp the nettle of reform . On the question of pace , I reassure people that in our first six months we have already legislated for fair pay agreements , delivered the biggest expansion of carer ’ s allowance since the 1970s , and immediately injected £86 million into the disabled facilities grant , with another £86 million to follow from April — £711 million in total over the next year — as well as the increased spending power for local government in the Budget and £880 million for social care specifically . With respect to the people who are saying , “ Go faster ” , I urge them to bear in mind that we have already done quite a lot in six months . We do not pretend that we have solved all the problems — we have not nearly solved all the problems — but that is not a bad start for a Government who are determined to show that we understand the pressures in social care today and are willing to deliver . The Dilnot proposals were very good technical responses to a question that Andrew Dilnot was set by David Cameron , but we should reflect on why it was that every single Prime Minister since Lord Cameron , including Lord Cameron himself , did not implement those reforms . There has always been something else in health and social care that has been more pressing and urgent . I am sure that Baroness Casey will consider the Dilnot proposals alongside all the other challenges and potential solutions to the wider issues in social care , but we are determined to respond at pace . That is why the first phase of the Casey commission will report next year , setting out an action plan throughout this Parliament . I hope that we can achieve broad consensus on those actions too . Turning to the winter situation , the right hon . Gentleman has asked what capacity there is .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-01-06.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-01-06.txt"}, {"score": 37.11656450338856, "chunk_id": "debates2025-05-13_F28", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-05-13.txt", "date": "2025-05-13", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Gentleman explain to the House why that is , what discussions he and other Ministers have had with Scottish Widows and others that have chosen not to take part , and what concerns they have raised ? Let me be clear : we on the Conservative Benches want a pensions industry that is investing in growing UK businesses , infrastructure , housing and all those elements that drive a healthier economy , but it also has to be for the benefit of savers . Of course , the risks in this case would be borne entirely by private sector workers , while public sector workers would be protected . Finally , we are clear that pension savings should never be there to dig a Chancellor out of the economic hole that she has made . I will directly address two questions and then come to the overall tone of the shadow Chancellor ’ s remarks . There has been a debate across this House and in the wider industry about mandation , including on UK equities . It has been led by Conservative peers in the House of Lords — Baroness Altmann has called for exactly that — and by some Members in this House , including the right hon . Member for Salisbury ( John Glen ) on the Conservative Benches . What we are setting out a voluntary agreement led by the industry . On the industry consensus behind the accord , 90 % of the defined contribution industry , by active savers , have signed up this morning — and all providers , including those that did not sign up today , are committed to the idea of more investment in private assets . More generally , the shadow Chancellor ’ s tone is disappointing . The truth is that he is a lonely figure . There is a wide consensus about the direction of travel to invest more in private assets , as Canadian and Australian pension funds do , and today ’ s accord is industry led ; it sets benchmarks agreed by the industry , and in fact many industry players want to go further . There should be cross - party consensus . At the event this morning , the Chancellor spelt out that this work builds on the work of her predecessor in supporting the 2023 Mansion House compact . The shadow Chancellor will remember that compact because it was signed under a Conservative Government when he was the Work and Pensions Secretary — he was in the press release , championing it . He was right then , and he is letting himself down now . I have some news : a response to the accord has just come in from Guy Opperman . Hon . Members will remember him , because he was the Conservative former Member for Hexham and the only Pensions Minister in the last Government to last more than five minutes ; he was in post for five years . What did he say about this morning ’ s accord ? He said that it is a “ good thing ” and “ should be welcomed ” — he is not wrong . I call the Chair of the Select Committee . I draw attention to my entry in the Register of Members ’ Financial Interests as a trustee of the parliamentary contributory pension fund . The points about fiduciary duty have been made . Given that fund managers will need time to pool together funds that reflect the Government ’ s wishes and the voluntary accord , when does the Minister expect it to kick in ? At that point , might he consider mandation ? The decision by the industry , reflecting the question that the Chair of the Select Committee raises about pace of change , is that the targets for asset allocation are for 2030 . I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-05-13.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-05-13.txt"}, {"score": 36.955871267972604, "chunk_id": "debates2025-05-01_F24", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-05-01.txt", "date": "2025-05-01", "parliament": "UK", "text": "As the Government consider what they will have to do to support energy - intensive industries such as distilling , will the Minister consider that the Scotch whisky industry in particular is critical to the maintenance of economic activity and good - quality jobs in some of the most remote and economically fragile communities in this country ? We are obviously keen to do what we can to support the Scottish whisky industry . I have been to see it and understand how important it is . The definitions of energy - intensive industries were developed under the previous Government , and we have no immediate plans to change those , but I will take away the right hon . Gentleman ’ s point and look into it . On net zero , I think there is a national consensus on making the environment better , creating green jobs and improving energy security , but will the Minister recognise that for many people , consumers and companies out there — particularly small businesses , by the way ; it is not all about large ones — there is too much happening , too soon and too fast ? Rather than having regressive and punitive taxes on industry and small businesses , there should be more education and more incentives to change consumer and company behaviour . The right hon . Gentleman makes a perfectly reasonable point . We have a national consensus that we need to act , and I think the population are with us on that . They understand that we need to make sure we have a planet for our children and our grandchildren and that we need to do everything we can . As was said this week , we want to tread lightly on people ’ s lives , and of course we do not want to inflict regressive and punitive taxation . We want to make sure we are supporting industry and business , and we are looking at how we can help to incentivise the changes that we need to see . Despite Scotland ’ s growing abundance of potentially cheap renewable energy , businesses in Scotland ’ s energy sector are dealt a double blow , whereby energy - intensive businesses in the renewables supply chain are hammered by high energy costs in production and extortionate transmission charges . When the Minister looks at this problem , as her colleague told me he would the other day , will she bear in mind that this is entirely linked to the high cost of producing energy and all the other ways in which the current energy market model serves Scotland poorly ? I think it was probably the Minister for Energy , my hon . Friend the Member for Rutherglen ( Michael Shanks ) , who gave that assurance to the hon . Gentleman , and he is looking at all these issues . We have a very complex energy system . We are trying to make it as cost - effective as we can , and sustainable in the long term , to give us the energy security that we all need . I am sure my hon . Friend will continue to look at these issues . A vital ingredient of any net zero policy is an understanding of the word “ net ” . Ultimately , we are going to have to grapple with technology that we have had for over a century to remove carbon directly from the air , aren ’ t we ? We are happy to look at a range of options . The whole point of the clean energy plan is that we are using a very diverse range of interventions , some of which are more high - tech and for the future , and some of which are well established . We need that mix .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-05-01.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-05-01.txt"}, {"score": 36.57801275307537, "chunk_id": "debates2025-01-24_F15", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-01-24.txt", "date": "2025-01-24", "parliament": "UK", "text": "The National Farmers Union has said , “ Please do not undermine UK agriculture by importing agricultural products produced to environmental standards that are different from ours here . ” A couple of weeks ago , I was visiting a friend in Thanet who allowed me to hold a facsimile of part of the skull of a Tyrannosaurus rex . The teeth were about nine inches to a foot long . Those beasts that ruled the Earth have been extinct for millions of years . We are supremely arrogant if we believe that “ Drill , baby , drill ” is the answer ; if we believe that we have a right — someone who wrote to me described it as a God - given right — to carbon fuels . A couple of weeks ago there was an exhibition in the House organised by Helping Rhinos , which seeks to defend the black rhino , and someone who attended made the case that the black rhino could outlive the human race . We are about to become — if we do not listen today — the authors of our own demise , and that is why I believe that the Bill deserves , at the very least , a Second Reading . From one old fogey to another , I presume . I have never enjoyed a speech by the right hon . Member for Herne Bay and Sandwich ( Sir Roger Gale ) as much as the one he has just delivered ; he did not bore the House in any way . I pay tribute to the hon . Member for South Cotswolds ( Dr Savage ) for introducing the Bill ; it has had a very long gestation , involving many Members on both sides of the House , but it is good that it has cross - party support . Indeed , the first thing I want to focus on is the importance of cross - party support . These issues had cross - party support in the House for many years following the Climate Change Act 2008 , and that continued until about 2015 . That was tremendously important in the progress that not only we but the world were able to make . People saw that it was possible for Parliament to come together and do things that were considered radical to tackle climate change . Latterly , unfortunately , that consensus has broken down somewhat , and it is important — it is the duty of all Members of the House — to try to repair that consensus and to build on it . Unless we do , we will face the sort of future that the hon . Lady and the right hon . Member for Herne Bay and Sandwich outlined . I am conscious that many people want to speak in the debate , so I will pick up quickly on just three issues in the Bill . First , clause 2 ( 2 ) states : “ The strategy must include annual interim targets consistent with the achievement of the objectives ” . Those objectives are the climate and nature targets , and it is great that the Bill makes the link between the two ; that is fundamentally important . However , I want to counsel against annual targets in this regard . As we know — it is well documented in the OEP report that the hon . Lady referred to , as well as in the Climate Change Committee ’ s reports — there is natural fluctuation annually in what happens around us . Sometimes that is because of the El Niño effect , and sometimes it is for other reasons — nobody in the House will be more familiar with the El Niño effect on the oceans than the hon . Lady .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-01-24.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-01-24.txt"}, {"score": 36.059892940139946, "chunk_id": "debates2024-03-22_F0", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-03-22.txt", "date": "2024-03-22", "parliament": "UK", "text": "[Document date: 2024-03-22]\nThe Chairman of Ways and Means took the Chair as Deputy Speaker ( Standing Order No . 3 ) .

Second Reading [ Relevant document : e - petition 650300 , Ban imports of hunting trophies of endangered animals . ] I beg to move , That the Bill be now read a Second time . Often in debates that have had a long genesis and been considered many times in the House , there is that hackneyed phrase : everything that needs to be said has been said , but not everyone has said it . One cannot even use that phrase now , because everyone has said what they need to say many times over . Of course , that is not true in this case , not least because of the Bill tabled and pioneered very ably by the hon . Member for Crawley ( Henry Smith ) in the last Session of Parliament . The clear and overwhelming view of this House was that the legislation should go forward . We all know that that Bill was subject to extended delays in the other House — without wishing to cast aspersions , one could almost suggest delaying tactics — and eventually time ran out . I have to say that in this regard , even if in no other , I welcome the postponement of the general election until the autumn , as I hope that will give us more than adequate time , not only for the Bill to go through its stages in this House , but to ensure that the majority in the other place are not frustrated by the few who take a different view of it . In some ways , what is happening down there is slightly reminiscent of the debate on the House of Lords in the early part of the last century , when the Lords were very much divided between the hedgers and the ditchers — between those who accepted that some reform was necessary and were therefore going to hedge their bets and allow reform to take place , and those who were going to die in the ditch . I hope very much that the hedgers in this case triumph in the other House , so that this matter , which is very important not just to us but to the public , makes progress . About this time last year , on Report , we reached somewhat of a compromise consensus on the Bill that left this place and went to the Lords . Am I right in thinking that the right hon . Gentleman has reintroduced the exact same Bill on which this House reached consensus last year ? The Bill technically does not stop hunting ; it simply stops the import into this country of any animal protected by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora . I thank the right hon . Lady for those comments , and for the work that she undertook as the Secretary of State to support this legislation . Given that we wish to speed the progress of this legislation , I hope that colleagues will not be prone to making long speeches on this issue — indeed , possibly not even medium or short speeches . Subject to Madam Deputy Speaker , I intend to be very generous with my taking of interventions , because right hon . and hon .

Earlier this year , I visited Feltham young offenders institution and witnessed at first hand the very challenging conditions in which dedicated professionals work with young people who have committed the most serious crimes and had a very difficult start in life . Back in 2016 , the Charlie Taylor review recommended that we move away from young offenders institutions to secure schools . The Government fully accepted his vision , yet seven years on not a single secure school has opened . One has been built , but it has not admitted any pupils . If the Government are serious about rehabilitating young offenders and cutting reoffending , when will they finally roll out secure schools for those pupils ? In a previous life as a Minister , as it were , I had youth justice in my portfolio back in 2018 - 19 , and I had the opportunity to visit Feltham at that time . I worked with Charlie Taylor on delivering those recommendations into practice . I am pleased to tell the hon . Lady that we anticipate the first secure school opening in 2024 . I welcome the new shadow Minister . Thank you , Mr Speaker . Education is vital to reduce violence , especially on the youth estate . However , violence on the youth estate is skyrocketing . Since last year , assaults on staff have increased by 33 % . That puts prison staff at risk in their workplace and increases the trauma experienced by children and young people . It can also prolong their rehabilitation . How will the Minister use education and other methods available to him to reduce that violence ? It is nice to be taking questions from the hon . Lady in her new role as shadow Minister , rather than when she used to question me in the Justice Committee . She is absolutely right to highlight the challenges of violence across the youth estate , which have been too high for too long , and we continue to work hard across all sites to address it . Among the measures put in place , we are ensuring that each child receives a full needs assessment , covering education , psychology , resettlement , health and behavioural support . Education and skills play a vital part in helping children and young people to get their lives back on course , but that must be in the context of a secure environment , because security has to be the premise on which all those other benefits can be delivered . What assessment he has made of the potential impact of the suspension of short sentences on the probation service . What assessment he has made of the potential impact of the suspension of short sentences on the probation service . To expand probation capacity , we have increased funding by £155 million a year to deliver effective supervision of offenders in the community . In 2020 - 21 we recruited an additional 1 , 000 trainee officers , 1 , 500 more in the following year , and 1 , 500 more in the year after that . This means that offenders who pose the highest risk to communities will receive robust supervision . Successive Conservative Ministers have allowed the criminal justice system to fall into its current parlous state , making many communities , including in Cambridge , less safe . Now they propose to shift the burden from an over - pressed prison service to an over - pressed probation service . Can the Secretary of State guarantee that the money that should have been available to prisons will be moved to the probation service to allow it to keep our communities safe ?", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-11-21.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-11-21.txt"}, {"score": 0.5360380411148071, "chunk_id": "debates2024-02-26_F17", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-02-26.txt", "date": "2024-02-26", "parliament": "UK", "text": "I am grateful to my hon .

Earlier this year , I visited Feltham young offenders institution and witnessed at first hand the very challenging conditions in which dedicated professionals work with young people who have committed the most serious crimes and had a very difficult start in life . Back in 2016 , the Charlie Taylor review recommended that we move away from young offenders institutions to secure schools . The Government fully accepted his vision , yet seven years on not a single secure school has opened . One has been built , but it has not admitted any pupils . If the Government are serious about rehabilitating young offenders and cutting reoffending , when will they finally roll out secure schools for those pupils ? In a previous life as a Minister , as it were , I had youth justice in my portfolio back in 2018 - 19 , and I had the opportunity to visit Feltham at that time . I worked with Charlie Taylor on delivering those recommendations into practice . I am pleased to tell the hon . Lady that we anticipate the first secure school opening in 2024 . I welcome the new shadow Minister . Thank you , Mr Speaker . Education is vital to reduce violence , especially on the youth estate . However , violence on the youth estate is skyrocketing . Since last year , assaults on staff have increased by 33 % . That puts prison staff at risk in their workplace and increases the trauma experienced by children and young people . It can also prolong their rehabilitation . How will the Minister use education and other methods available to him to reduce that violence ? It is nice to be taking questions from the hon . Lady in her new role as shadow Minister , rather than when she used to question me in the Justice Committee . She is absolutely right to highlight the challenges of violence across the youth estate , which have been too high for too long , and we continue to work hard across all sites to address it . Among the measures put in place , we are ensuring that each child receives a full needs assessment , covering education , psychology , resettlement , health and behavioural support . Education and skills play a vital part in helping children and young people to get their lives back on course , but that must be in the context of a secure environment , because security has to be the premise on which all those other benefits can be delivered .

What assessment he has made of the potential impact of the suspension of short sentences on the probation service . To expand probation capacity , we have increased funding by £155 million a year to deliver effective supervision of offenders in the community . In 2020 - 21 we recruited an additional 1 , 000 trainee officers , 1 , 500 more in the following year , and 1 , 500 more in the year after that . This means that offenders who pose the highest risk to communities will receive robust supervision . Successive Conservative Ministers have allowed the criminal justice system to fall into its current parlous state , making many communities , including in Cambridge , less safe . Now they propose to shift the burden from an over - pressed prison service to an over - pressed probation service .

That causes havoc for residents , it is dangerous for pedestrians , and can be fatal for those who are on those bikes . Those young reoffenders often have little else to do , as there are few education , training or employment opportunities , so can the Minister please set out how this Government will end the scourge of offroad bikes and reoffending , and how they will once again be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime ? My hon . Friend is exactly right . In the past , antisocial behaviour has been too easily dismissed as low - level , but as he rightly describes , it can cause real distress and misery to our communities . I am pleased that the new Crime and Policing Bill includes measures to enhance police powers to seize nuisance offroad bikes and other vehicles used in an antisocial manner .

My hon . Friend is exactly right . What Engineered Learning is doing is a clear win - win , teaching welding skills and moving people away from crime . The Department will continue funding youth offending teams to work with local education and employment providers to help young people get the skills they need to have productive careers and positive lives .

We have regular discussions with the Department for Education on these matters . The hon . Gentleman is absolutely right : the more young people we get into training , education and work , the less crime we should have on our streets . I thank the Minister very much for that answer . Quite clearly , those who reoffend do so because they go back to where the peer pressure is , where the unemployment is , and where poverty levels are high . Those are things that must be addressed in order to help these young people not to reoffend . They are big issues ; what can be done to ensure those three things in the localities where those young people live do not overtake them , with the problems they have ? The hon . Gentleman is absolutely right that all those issues contribute to circumstances that might create offending , but it is really good that we have the turnaround programme in place . Only 5 % of children who completed their turnaround interventions received convictions in their first year of the programme .

The police will of course help when there is a threat to life or safety or when criminality is involved , but when the emergency is purely medical , for instance when someone is undergoing a mental health crisis , it is for the NHS to respond , and the nationwide roll - out of the Right Care , Right Person model across England — and soon , I hope , across Wales as well — will ensure that a medical response comes when it is needed .

He should actually be backing the Government , because we are getting on with closing these hotels .

That causes havoc for residents , it is dangerous for pedestrians , and can be fatal for those who are on those bikes . Those young reoffenders often have little else to do , as there are few education , training or employment opportunities , so can the Minister please set out how this Government will end the scourge of offroad bikes and reoffending , and how they will once again be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime ? My hon . Friend is exactly right . In the past , antisocial behaviour has been too easily dismissed as low - level , but as he rightly describes , it can cause real distress and misery to our communities . I am pleased that the new Crime and Policing Bill includes measures to enhance police powers to seize nuisance offroad bikes and other vehicles used in an antisocial manner .

My hon . Friend is exactly right . What Engineered Learning is doing is a clear win - win , teaching welding skills and moving people away from crime . The Department will continue funding youth offending teams to work with local education and employment providers to help young people get the skills they need to have productive careers and positive lives . Aspiration and ambition are drivers of social mobility and help to reduce deprivation and crime . What discussions has the Minister had with the Department for Education to increase apprenticeships and training , so that these opportunities can be extended to all and we can reduce young offending throughout the UK ? We have regular discussions with the Department for Education on these matters . The hon . Gentleman is absolutely right : the more young people we get into training , education and work , the less crime we should have on our streets . I thank the Minister very much for that answer . Quite clearly , those who reoffend do so because they go back to where the peer pressure is , where the unemployment is , and where poverty levels are high . Those are things that must be addressed in order to help these young people not to reoffend . They are big issues ; what can be done to ensure those three things in the localities where those young people live do not overtake them , with the problems they have ? The hon . Gentleman is absolutely right that all those issues contribute to circumstances that might create offending , but it is really good that we have the turnaround programme in place . Only 5 % of children who completed their turnaround interventions received convictions in their first year of the programme .

Speaker , I rise today to pay tribute to an individual whose unwavering dedication to education has transformed countless lives and communities : Dr . Paul Gothold . Throughout his distinguished career , Dr . Gothold has epitomized the values of equity , inclusivity , and excellence in education , ensuring that every child has access to the opportunities they need to thrive . Dr . Gothold & # x27 ; s journey in education began over three decades ago as a teacher , where he worked tirelessly with adjudicated , probation , and expelled youth in Los Angeles . From these early experiences , he developed a deep understanding of the challenges facing underserved communities and a steadfast commitment to addressing them . As he advanced in his career , Dr . Gothold continued to demonstrate exceptional leadership and innovation . As Superintendent of Lynwood Unified in Los Angeles , he led the district to remarkable achievements , including increasing graduation rates from 58 percent to 90 percent at all comprehensive high schools . Under his stewardship , Lynwood Unified was honored as the College Board District of the Year , a testament to its success in expanding AP participation and passage rates for underserved populations . Beyond his role as district leader , Dr . Gothold has also made a significant contributions to educator preparation and professional development . As an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California , he has mentored and coached numerous aspiring and sitting superintendents , shaping the next generation of education leaders . In 2017 , Dr . Gothold assumed the role of San Diego County Superintendent , where his impact has been nothing short of transformative . His visionary leadership has led to the creation of groundbreaking initiatives and partnerships that have enriched the educational experiences of students across the county . One of Dr . Gothold & # x27 ; s key accomplishments has been his commitment to ensuring school safety and addressing the needs of vulnerable populations . Through partnerships with the San Diego District Attorney & # x27 ; s office , he developed county - wide school safety protocols and training to prevent human trafficking . Additionally , he spearheaded initiatives to support foster , homeless , and adjudicated youth , including the creation of innovative programs and pathways to success .

I welcome the hon . Gentleman ’ s question . I am absolutely committed to the target of 600 , 000 .

What recent assessment she has made of the implications for her policies of trends in the level of violence in classrooms . Of course , no one should face violence in school . In England , we have taken decisive action to improve pupils ’ behaviour through strengthening the behaviour in schools guidance and investing in giving support and propagating best practice through the behaviour hubs . The latest PISA figures , which were released in the last few weeks , show a stark picture of violence in schools across the whole UK . Nowhere else in the OECD do rates of violence reach anywhere near the levels in the UK . Pupils are almost twice as likely as the OECD average to witness a fight in their school — 39 % in England and 36 % in Scotland — and , as a teacher , I can say from experience that violence in schools disrupts every part of pupils ’ learning . Exclusion clearly is not working , and the Scottish Government ’ s recently announced proposal in Scotland is to put all the responsibility on teachers . What more can the Government do to illustrate a way forward for schools to deal with this problem , so that young people ’ s learning is not hampered by violence in the classroom ? For completeness , we ought to note that the PISA study noted that the great majority of pupils in England reported feeling safe in school — very similar to the OECD average — and were less likely than the OECD average to see the most serious manifestations of such behaviour , such as seeing gangs at school or seeing somebody with a weapon . It is absolutely true that schools must have the full range of measures at their disposal . There is no right level of exclusion , and it should not be used lightly , but it has to be there ; it has to be available . Early in our time in government , we made it clear that teachers can use reasonable force . We also extended searching powers , removed the requirement to give parents 24 hours ’ written notice for after - school detentions and simplified advice on how to prevent and tackle bullying , because a safe and ordered environment is essential for both children ’ s education and their general wellbeing .
