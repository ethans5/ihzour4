Once the Great British Energy Bill finishes its final stages in Parliament , we will come forward with more exciting plans for our domestic clean energy champion . I welcome the £300 million of investment for GB Energy announced last week . I think we all recognise the opportunities of the green energy transition , but what opportunities are there for my Harlow constituents to be part of that publicly owned energy company ? My hon . Friend is absolutely right to point out that , with Great British Energy and our clean power mission , we are trying to create the jobs that will deliver that transition here in the UK , which is something that the Conservatives failed on for many years . We expect that funding , and much more that will come from Great British Energy , to mobilise more than £1 billion in private investment in domestic supply chains , driving forward manufacturing and industry here in the UK and the good jobs that go with it . What assessment has the Minister made of the number of jobs that Great British Energy will create in the People ’ s Republic of China ? I think the right hon . Gentleman gives the game away there . Although the Conservative party did not particularly care where the supply chains were , we in the Labour party are committed to delivering good , well - paid jobs in this country . If he was so concerned about investing in British supply chains , he might have bothered to vote for Great British Energy in the first place . I call the shadow Minister . When GB Energy was first proposed , we were told it would employ 1 , 000 people and create 650 , 000 jobs . Fast - forward to February this year and that number has been revised down to 200 to 300 , with a vague commitment to 1 , 000 at some point in the next 20 years . As the general secretary of the GMB said yesterday , “ they are going to open a shiny new office…on a high street full of charity shops because they are closing ” the city of Aberdeen down . GB Energy is a white elephant . If the GMB can see it , why cannot the Minister ? Surely he agrees that the way to deliver jobs , growth and energy security and to protect communities such as Aberdeen is to lift the ban on licences , replace the energy profits levy as soon as possible and declare the North sea open for business . I am not quite sure which one of the variety of parts in that speech the hon . Gentleman would like me to respond to . As usual , he steamrolls through his question faster than he ran the marathon — I congratulate him on that . He happens to be the only person in Aberdeenshire who is against investment in his community . When Labour Members voted to deliver investment through Great British Energy — not through jobs in the headquarters but through the investment it makes in supply chains and innovation in his city — he voted against it , and he will have to answer to his constituents for that . What steps he is taking to support the nuclear power sector . Nuclear power is a critical part of our clean power ambitions . We are making strong progress on Sizewell C and Great British Nuclear is driving forward its small modular reactor competition .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-04-29.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-04-29.txt"}, {"rank": 5, "score": 35.427046265991294, "chunk_id": "debates2025-03-03_F22", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-03-03.txt", "date": "2025-03-03", "parliament": "UK", "text": "There are of course many areas where the Prime Minister and I disagree , but now is the time for us to discuss where we do agree . I welcome all his actions this weekend to convene European leaders , as well as the focus on economic security , using UK Export Finance to support British jobs . As the Prime Minister knows , we welcome the uplift in defence spending to 2 . 5 % of GDP by 2027 , and we support the use of foreign aid to achieve that . We welcome a commitment to reach 3 % in the years ahead , and we will support him in taking difficult spending decisions , including on welfare . We will return to the details of how the Government will fund this in the near future , but for now it is right that the Prime Minister is working with allies in Europe and with the United States to bring peace to Ukraine , and not a surrender to Russia . As part of that , the Prime Minister has suggested that British troops could be deployed in Ukraine . There are obviously a range of possible options for what such a deployment could look like , and we are keen to work with the Government , but we will need details of any such plan . This will be a difficult but significant step . I know many in Parliament , and across our country , will be interested in what this entails , and I ask him to work with us so there can be effective scrutiny . I also welcome the coalition of the willing to support Ukraine and agree that Europe must do the heavy lifting . Will the Prime Minister update us on what European and other allies are willing to offer towards this coalition ? I welcome the use of the proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine . Does the Prime Minister have plans to go further and use the frozen assets themselves ? Will he provide an update on the Government ’ s sanctions on Russian - linked individuals and confirmation that such sanctions would not be lifted in the event of a ceasefire ? Will he update us on the steps that he and other allies are taking to ensure that Ukraine is at the negotiating table for any peace plan ? What does he think can be done to heal the rift with Washington ? As the Prime Minister referenced in his speech , the Minsk agreements of 2015 failed to stop Russian aggression and ultimately did not return Ukraine ’ s territorial integrity . His second principle is that any lasting peace guarantees the sovereignty of Ukraine , so how will the Prime Minister work to ensure we avoid a repeat of the Minsk agreements ? How can we ensure that any peace fully protects Ukrainian sovereignty ? At times like these , it is so important that we stand together to defend shared values and the fundamental basic principle that aggressors should not win . The Prime Minister will have our support to do that and to ensure that we continue to uphold the values that all of us in this Parliament hold dear . I thank the Leader of the Opposition for her message and for our discussion this morning , and I thank her for her support for the measures that we are taking . It matters across this House that we are united on this issue , It matters to the Ukrainians and to President Zelensky . I can tell the right hon .

As a former republican , he used to think that this country should not even have a King ’ s Speech , but at least that is one U - turn the whole country will welcome . The right hon . and learned Gentleman is prone to changing his position , but in fairness his speech did strike a few consistent notes : higher inflation , more strikes , more immigration and higher borrowing . The Labour party ’ s plan to unnecessarily borrow £28 billion more every year and give in to inflation - busting pay demands from its union paymasters is dangerous , inflationary , and the British people would pay the price in higher interest rates and higher taxes . In truth , Labour will borrow anything — people ’ s money or people ’ s ideas — and it now turns out that his copy - and - paste shadow Chancellor is happy to borrow other people ’ s work , too , but she is not the only Member on the Opposition Benches to get unstuck by a book . Earlier this year , the Leader of the Opposition had to abandon writing his own book and return the deposit . It was supposed to be his vision for Britain , but his publishers discovered what the British people already know : he simply does not have one . While he stands for the same old ideas , we are focused on the long - term decisions that will provide a better and brighter future for everyone . That is what this King ’ s Speech will deliver . That change starts with changing our economy . We have already delivered the largest fall in inflation since the 1980s , a faster recovery from the pandemic than Germany , France and Japan , and tens of billions of pounds of new investment from around the world . We believe that the role of Government is to create the conditions for the private sector to thrive . That is where new growth and new jobs come from . It is why we have given business a £27 billion tax cut on investment , launched 12 freeports around the UK to create jobs and investment , and introduced legislation in this King ’ s Speech so that we can confirm our membership of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans - Pacific partnership , a huge trading pact with the fastest growing region in the world . [ Interruption . ] I hear from those on the Opposition Benches that it will make no difference . We can only do that because of our new freedoms outside the European Union — freedoms that the Leader of the Opposition wants to abandon , instead locking the United Kingdom into a new European deal that would tie us into EU rules and regulations that we would have no say over and opening our borders to 100 , 000 additional EU migrants every single year . As well as failing to secure our borders , the Opposition would also fail to secure our energy supplies . We know that economic growth requires energy security . We have already invested record amounts in renewables such as offshore wind . We backed Sizewell C , the first new nuclear in decades . The King ’ s Speech introduces new legislation for North sea oil and gas , supporting hundreds of thousands of British jobs . We can compare and contrast that with the Opposition ’ s energy policy — Will the Prime Minister give way ? [ Interruption . ] Order . Members have the right to intervene .

We will recognise the bravery of those on the frontline of keeping us safe with a new armed forces commissioner . That is not just a name or a role , but a strong and independent champion for those who have committed to the ultimate service as a way in which we can show our respect . We will also move quickly on the lessons from the infected blood scandal that the House debated in almost the final act of the last Session : a day when we — all of us — undertook a solemn responsibility not just to deliver justice to those people , but to take on the work of prevention , to ensure that those lessons shape the future of public service in our country . Because scandals like infected blood , Windrush , Horizon and Hillsborough are united not just by the scale of the injustice , but by the indignity that the victims and their families have been put through merely for standing up for truth and justice . So it is high time to bring in a duty of candour — the Hillsborough law — because a Government of service must also be a Government of accountability and justice . That is what service means . I thank the Prime Minister for giving way during his excellent speech , outlining the hope and renewal within the King ’ s Speech , which is much needed in constituencies such as mine , Luton North , where over 45 % of children are growing up in relative poverty . What reassurances can he give me and my constituents that he personally takes this issue seriously and that his Government will address it ? Let me reassure my hon . Friend and the whole House that I take child poverty extremely seriously . I am proud of the last Labour Government ’ s record on reducing child poverty ; they clearly had a strategy , and we will have a strategy . I am very pleased to have announced today the taskforce that will lead our strategy to reduce child poverty . No child should grow up in poverty . We will work across the House on that issue . I am grateful to the Prime Minister for giving way on his newly announced taskforce , which Beth Rigby announced on Twitter as we were all in this Chamber . Can the Prime Minister outline how many children will remain in poverty while that taskforce undertakes its work , which ultimately will lead to the same conclusion that we are proposing — to scrap the two - child benefit cap ? I do welcome this , and I know that it is an issue across the whole House — I do not think there is a single Member who does not care about child poverty . The point of the taskforce is to devise a strategy , as we did when we were last in government , to drive those numbers down . It cannot be a single issue , but one that crosses a number of strands , and we will work with people across the House in order to tackle it . What matters is the commitment to drive those numbers down . That is what we did when last in government , and we will do it again . rose — I will make some progress and then give way .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-07-17.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-07-17.txt"}, {"rank": 3, "score": 36.82429521500478, "chunk_id": "debates2023-11-15_F10", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2023-11-15.txt", "date": "2023-11-15", "parliament": "UK", "text": "A lot of Members wish to speak . Those who do not want that to happen , please , go outside and have a conversation there . If you want to bawl and shout , do it elsewhere , but it will not be happening in here today . I am so glad that the Prime Minister agrees that this is a changed Labour party . While he was wasting his time on this gimmick , the asylum backlog has swollen to 175 , 000 people . Taxpayers are paying £8 million a day on hotel bills , and 615 people arrived by small boat last Sunday alone . Plan A has failed . After this session , whether he likes it or not , he will have to go back to his office , back to the drawing board and start from scratch . Can he assure the British public that he will drop what his former Home Secretary calls his “ magical thinking ” and start treating small boat crossings with the seriousness they deserve ? The right hon . and learned Gentleman talks about a changed Labour party — perhaps we will see that this evening . He cannot even make his party do the right thing when it comes to standing by Israel in the vote later today . He talks about taking small boat crossings seriously . He has opposed every single measure that we have taken . Let me update him on what we have done this year . The number of illegal Albanian arrivals is down by 90 % . Some 20 , 000 people have been returned this year . The number of crossings is down by a third . He mentioned hotels . We are closing 50 of them , with money being saved for taxpayers . All those measures , by the way , were opposed by the Opposition . What is his plan ? Ah , yes , there we have it : a cosy deal with the European Union that would see the UK accept 100 , 000 illegal migrants . He does not want to stop the boats ; he wants to welcome more of them . It is very straightforward : the Prime Minister promised that he would stop the boats this year . Today is 15 November . He has wasted all his time on a gimmick , and now he is absolutely nowhere . Will he level with the British public and finally admit that he has failed to deliver on his promise ? This Government have done more to tackle illegal migration than any in the past . Let us review : the right hon . and learned Gentleman has been on the wrong side of this issue his entire career . This is a man who described all immigration law as racist . He said it was a mistake to control immigration , and he has never once in this place voted for stricter asylum rules . It is clear that while he might want to listen to the open - border activists , I am siding with the British people . If the Prime Minister was confident about his promise , he would have given an answer saying that he stands by it and will deliver it by the end of the year . The absence of that answer is absolutely amazing in the circumstances . He has had three reshuffles , a forgotten conference speech , an empty King ’ s Speech — he even found time to fanboy Elon Musk — but not one of them has made the slightest difference to the lives of working people . If we had a pound for every time he had a reset , the cost of living crisis would have been over long ago .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2023-11-15.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2023-11-15.txt"}, {"rank": 4, "score": 36.16928990907859, "chunk_id": "debates2025-04-29_F12", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-04-29.txt", "date": "2025-04-29", "parliament": "UK", "text": "Just last week , the Prime Minister announced £300 million for Great British Energy to kick - start supply chains here in the UK . Once the Great British Energy Bill finishes its final stages in Parliament , we will come forward with more exciting plans for our domestic clean energy champion . I welcome the £300 million of investment for GB Energy announced last week . I think we all recognise the opportunities of the green energy transition , but what opportunities are there for my Harlow constituents to be part of that publicly owned energy company ? My hon . Friend is absolutely right to point out that , with Great British Energy and our clean power mission , we are trying to create the jobs that will deliver that transition here in the UK , which is something that the Conservatives failed on for many years . We expect that funding , and much more that will come from Great British Energy , to mobilise more than £1 billion in private investment in domestic supply chains , driving forward manufacturing and industry here in the UK and the good jobs that go with it . What assessment has the Minister made of the number of jobs that Great British Energy will create in the People ’ s Republic of China ? I think the right hon . Gentleman gives the game away there . Although the Conservative party did not particularly care where the supply chains were , we in the Labour party are committed to delivering good , well - paid jobs in this country . If he was so concerned about investing in British supply chains , he might have bothered to vote for Great British Energy in the first place . I call the shadow Minister . When GB Energy was first proposed , we were told it would employ 1 , 000 people and create 650 , 000 jobs . Fast - forward to February this year and that number has been revised down to 200 to 300 , with a vague commitment to 1 , 000 at some point in the next 20 years . As the general secretary of the GMB said yesterday , “ they are going to open a shiny new office…on a high street full of charity shops because they are closing ” the city of Aberdeen down . GB Energy is a white elephant . If the GMB can see it , why cannot the Minister ? Surely he agrees that the way to deliver jobs , growth and energy security and to protect communities such as Aberdeen is to lift the ban on licences , replace the energy profits levy as soon as possible and declare the North sea open for business . I am not quite sure which one of the variety of parts in that speech the hon . Gentleman would like me to respond to . As usual , he steamrolls through his question faster than he ran the marathon — I congratulate him on that . He happens to be the only person in Aberdeenshire who is against investment in his community . When Labour Members voted to deliver investment through Great British Energy — not through jobs in the headquarters but through the investment it makes in supply chains and innovation in his city — he voted against it , and he will have to answer to his constituents for that . What steps he is taking to support the nuclear power sector . Nuclear power is a critical part of our clean power ambitions .

I welcome all his actions this weekend to convene European leaders , as well as the focus on economic security , using UK Export Finance to support British jobs . As the Prime Minister knows , we welcome the uplift in defence spending to 2 . 5 % of GDP by 2027 , and we support the use of foreign aid to achieve that . We welcome a commitment to reach 3 % in the years ahead , and we will support him in taking difficult spending decisions , including on welfare . We will return to the details of how the Government will fund this in the near future , but for now it is right that the Prime Minister is working with allies in Europe and with the United States to bring peace to Ukraine , and not a surrender to Russia . As part of that , the Prime Minister has suggested that British troops could be deployed in Ukraine . There are obviously a range of possible options for what such a deployment could look like , and we are keen to work with the Government , but we will need details of any such plan . This will be a difficult but significant step . I know many in Parliament , and across our country , will be interested in what this entails , and I ask him to work with us so there can be effective scrutiny . I also welcome the coalition of the willing to support Ukraine and agree that Europe must do the heavy lifting . Will the Prime Minister update us on what European and other allies are willing to offer towards this coalition ? I welcome the use of the proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine . Does the Prime Minister have plans to go further and use the frozen assets themselves ? Will he provide an update on the Government ’ s sanctions on Russian - linked individuals and confirmation that such sanctions would not be lifted in the event of a ceasefire ? Will he update us on the steps that he and other allies are taking to ensure that Ukraine is at the negotiating table for any peace plan ? What does he think can be done to heal the rift with Washington ? As the Prime Minister referenced in his speech , the Minsk agreements of 2015 failed to stop Russian aggression and ultimately did not return Ukraine ’ s territorial integrity . His second principle is that any lasting peace guarantees the sovereignty of Ukraine , so how will the Prime Minister work to ensure we avoid a repeat of the Minsk agreements ? How can we ensure that any peace fully protects Ukrainian sovereignty ? At times like these , it is so important that we stand together to defend shared values and the fundamental basic principle that aggressors should not win . The Prime Minister will have our support to do that and to ensure that we continue to uphold the values that all of us in this Parliament hold dear . I thank the Leader of the Opposition for her message and for our discussion this morning , and I thank her for her support for the measures that we are taking . It matters across this House that we are united on this issue , It matters to the Ukrainians and to President Zelensky . I can tell the right hon . Lady that he was moved by the reception that he got in our country on Saturday , and I felt very proud to be British on Saturday when our country spoke with one voice .

Whether it is regenerating local high streets , investing in parks and green spaces or tackling antisocial behaviour , we are levelling up across the country and he deserves enormous praise for his role in securing that investment . I call the Scottish National party leader . This week , a former Prime Minister who oversaw a financial crash before being unceremoniously turfed from office told the public the truth — and I am not referring to that one , Mr Speaker . On Monday , Gordon Brown told the people of these isles that “ the forces pulling Britain apart are greater than the forces holding it together ” . Maybe the Prime Minister can find some time this afternoon to agree with just one of his predecessors ? Where I do agree with my predecessor very strongly is that Scotland would be far stronger inside the United Kingdom . Gordon Brown was also correct in stating that Scottish independence is not simply off the agenda . Those remarks were echoed just yesterday by the general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress , who stated that it remained an unresolved issue — [ Laughter . ] Conservative Members may laugh at her , but she went on to say : “ That can be a very dangerous place to end up in when you are not allowing people to express their wishes in a democratic manner . ” Does the Prime Minister welcome the fulsome , wholehearted and warm support of the Labour party in denying the people of Scotland the opportunity to have a say over their own future ? We did have a democratic vote on that topic , but I would suggest to the SNP that , rather than obsessing about independence , and wasting time cracking down on free speech and trying to lock up J . K . Rowling , he should focus on what the people of Scotland care about : schools , hospitals , jobs and our new tax cuts . I abhor a two - tier policing system , and we must ensure that everyone is treated equally under the rule of law . The Labour police and crime commissioner who investigated the beergate scandal handed their police chief constable a new three - year contract while the investigation into the Labour party leader and deputy leader was ongoing . Now , two former MPs are overseeing the force due to investigate the Labour deputy leader . Does the Prime Minister agree that complete transparency throughout this investigation is of the utmost importance ? My hon . Friend makes an important point . A key principle of our country is that there are the same rules for everyone . On this topic , the Labour leader should show some leadership : stop reading the legal advice ; simply publish it and get a grip of the situation . It says a lot about his priorities that , with his famed legal expertise , he is more than happy to help defend Hizb ut - Tahrir but refuses to help his deputy . The recently published Kenova report makes it clear that the IRA was riddled with British agents from top to bottom . Those agents were involved in the abduction , torture and murder of British and Irish citizens . The British Government — successive British Governments — knew all about it and did nothing . The report also calls for an apology from the Government to those victims . Will the Prime Minister take this opportunity to make that apology ? As the hon .

Is it not time that we perhaps rearranged the furniture in this House , had them all on one big Bench and re - titled them the “ This is what you get from the UK party ” ? I thank the hon . Gentleman for his question , and I will leave him and the Labour party to debate the finer points of policy between them . On the substance , because it is important , the track record demonstrates that we are making a difference and reducing child poverty . There are now 400 , 000 fewer children in poverty than there were in 2010 , as a result of the actions of this Government — notably , by moving their parents into work , because that has the single best benefit for those children . That is the right policy and it is one that we will continue to deliver . Conversion therapy is quackery packaged up by bigots seeking to promote their hate and to profit from it . On 19 January , a Minister promised at the Dispatch Box to bring forward a ban against conversion therapy and ensure that pre - legislative scrutiny was completed before the end of this parliamentary term . How does my right hon . Friend plan to continue that ? May I also welcome his statement today and thank those LGBT veterans who are with us ? We are so grateful for their service and we seek this ban also in their name . I thank my hon . Friend for her question . I agree with her that conversion therapy is an abhorrent practice , and we need to do everything we can to stamp it out wherever we see it . The Minister for Women and Equalities , my right hon . Friend the Member for Saffron Walden ( Kemi Badenoch ) , will continue to keep my hon . Friend and the House updated on her progress . Does the Prime Minister remember seven years ago , when he was a passionate supporter of leaving the European Union , along with his then best friend , Boris Johnson ? Is he aware that Sir John Major now says , in every speech he makes , that that decision was catastrophic for the people of this country and living standards , as well as deeply damaging to our role , status and influence in the world ? I would say gently to the hon . Gentleman that he made the central point at the beginning of his question : it was seven years ago , and we need to move forward . He talked about what has happened since then . Since we left the single market , this economy has grown faster than Germany , France and Italy . He also talked about our standing on the world stage . He obviously was not here for the statement on the NATO summit last week , but nobody can be in any doubt that the United Kingdom is highly respected on the world stage . Just last week the Leader of the Opposition announced his new flagship policy — the two - child benefit cap . It is very popular on this side of the House , but it is not so popular on the other side . Can the Prime Minister tell the House when the Leader of the Opposition will jump off the bandwagon , be honest with the British public and tell them what he stands for ? My hon . Friend is right . I welcome the Leader of the Opposition now supporting the Government ’ s policy , but I do not think anyone actually believes that he believes in what he says .

Does he realise how ludicrous it looks when he spends his time boasting while Britain is breaking ? I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition has brought up our schools ; there is nothing more important than ensuring that our children get a world - class education . That is why I am pleased that , in spite of Labour opposing every reform we have made , our children are now the best readers in the western world . But he is right that attendance is important . That is why we are investing millions of pounds more to provide support for absent pupils . We have launched a national campaign just this week . We have doubled the number of attendance hubs to support more than 1 , 000 at the most vulnerable schools . I am surprised to hear him raise that topic , because , from longer lockdowns to voting against our minimum service laws , his priority has always been keeping our children out of school . It is always the same with him : there is no plan . It is just peddling one thing to his union friends and another thing to the British people . New year , new nonsense .

Does he agree that the first thing that must be looked at is the spending of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to lease back the defence base on Diego Garcia , which we currently own ? Why is he still pursuing that deal ? Earlier today , I made a speech about the realism that should drive our foreign policy . As part of that , he must scrap his disastrous plan to surrender the Chagos islands and have British taxpayers pay for the privilege . The key difference between we Conservatives and the Labour party is that we know that we need a strong economy for defence . We need a serious plan to get the British economy growing again . We do not have that with the latest Budget from the Chancellor . Will the Prime Minister tell us whether there will be a fiscal event this spring , even though his Government are committed to only one fiscal event per year ? In summary , the Prime Minister made four points . I agree with him that NATO is a bedrock of our security , as I said this morning , and that the US is our most important bilateral relationship , but friends tell each other when they disagree . We agree on this issue ; we know that Ukraine must be supported , and I share his concern about statements that have been made about President Zelensky . I agree with him about protecting security in Europe , and I welcome his continued strengthening of alliances , but we must do that through NATO , building on the joint expeditionary force approach . Of course , we agree that we need peace , with Ukraine agreed . I do not necessarily agree with the Prime Minister ’ s change of the national security posture , because we have different views on that — I am a Conservative realist , not a progressive internationalist — but I want him to know that when he does the right thing , we will work with him in the national interest . May I first thank the Leader of the Opposition for her support in relation to today ’ s announcement and on Ukraine ? That is important to the Government , to the House and , most of all , to the Ukrainians and President Zelensky . They want to see unity in our House — they value unity in our House — as they enter , after three years of conflict , a very difficult stage in the war with Russia and against Russian aggression . I hope and believe that we can maintain that unity in relation to Ukraine , as we have done for three years . I am very proud that this House has done that , notwithstanding a change of Government , for three long years — we will continue to do so . The Leader of the Oppositions asks about the money for defence , security and intelligence . There was new money in the Budget in relation to that , but what I am doing here is in addition to the 2 . 5 % , which is the increased defence spend as it has always been understood , to recognise that the nature of the threats to our county are different now , and that the security and intelligence services play a key part for us and our allies in our defence . That takes the total to 2 . 6 % .

We will remember them . Thank you for granting this urgent question , Mr Speaker , especially on Armistice Day . I am grateful for the Secretary of State ’ s response , but he keeps going back to 2010 when we spent 2 . 5 % . That is true , but he says it without adding the fact that his Government had bankrupted the country . In fact , I asked the House of Commons Library about this . The Institute for Fiscal Studies has confirmed that if Labour had returned to government , it was planning cuts to the defence budget of 20 % to 25 % . But this question is about today . The threat picture is far graver than it has been for many generations , as the Chief of the Defence Staff confirmed at the weekend . As the Secretary of State says , the Labour party committed in its general election manifesto to a “ path to spending 2 . 5 per cent of GDP on defence . ” The Prime Minister said shortly after taking office that it was “ cast iron ” , which the Secretary of State has repeated today . With President Trump ’ s election victory , there will inevitably be a greater focus on what more European NATO members can do to boost Europe ’ s own defence , but yesterday the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and this morning the Secretary of State himself were unable to say whether the Government would deliver on 2 . 5 % in the current Parliament . In addition , yesterday The Sunday Times reported that Defence Equipment and Support in Abbey Wood has effectively been instructed to avoid any new procurement at all for the rest of this financial year . Spending 2 . 5 % is not an end in itself . The key reason that in April we set out a fully funded multi - year pathway to 2 . 5 % was to enable the Ministry of Defence to procure , at pace and at scale , the munitions that we need to urgently replenish our stocks to warfighting levels . With the whole world wanting to buy more munitions , we cannot afford to delay any further . I have key questions for the Secretary of State , because at the same time we are having this debate , there are a whole load of new burdens coming for the MOD which it will have to cover . In which financial year does he expect the share of GDP spent on defence to start rising significantly , and will he guarantee to hit 2 . 5 % in this Parliament — yes or no ? Not including existing programmes , is it true that there is a freeze on new procurement of defence equipment and support for the rest of this financial year ? Will the MOD be 100 % compensated by the Treasury for higher employer national insurance contributions and for the cost of increasing continuity of education allowance , and will service families be 100 % compensated for the extra VAT on school fees ?", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-11-11.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-11-11.txt"}, {"rank": 2, "score": 0.6399901509284973, "chunk_id": "debates2024-03-11_F28", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-03-11.txt", "date": "2024-03-11", "parliament": "UK", "text": "He will be presented with the conflict that develops , and we need the capability and resilience to meet threats that emerge . What assessment has he made of the threats to the United Kingdom , and how will he meet those threats with the armed forces he has ? The hon . Gentleman ’ s rather trite comment on procurement is a total failure to understand how the military works . He wants to talk about the deterrent ; everything from our nuclear submarines right down to small arms is part of the procurement system . They all have to be procured . My priority is ensuring that we have a procurement system that is agile , gets equipment to the frontline as fast as possible , and can engage with the latest technological developments ; think of lasers and uncrewed systems . Technology is moving at an extraordinary pace . We have used technology to support Ukraine so far . We have provided 4 , 000 drones and will increase our support to around 10 , 000 . We are doing everything possible to support Ukraine . All that is done through the procurement system — if I may say so , highly effectively . I join my hon . Friend in commending the professionalism of our armed forces , and in pointing out that Labour has not committed to an increase in defence spending , but may I remind him that the first duty of any Government is to ensure that defence spending primarily reflects the threat , rather than the ability to pay ? We have a war in Europe . We have an increasingly belligerent Russia . I chair the defence committee of the 1922 committee . Conservative Back Benchers are very much behind the idea that we need to increase defence spending . What does the Minister think it will take to increase defence spending ? First of all , we have increased defence spending . Crucially , the last spending review saw the largest allocation of spending to defence since the cold war . Yes , we have set an aspiration of 2 . 5 % , and the answer to when that will happen is : when economic conditions allow . It would be imprudent to commit to such a level of spending if we did not think it could be sustained . The worst thing would be to have that spending for maybe one or two years , and then have to go backwards because we did not think it was sustainable . This is about balancing affordability against commitment , but we need to be absolutely clear that at over £50 billion , this is the most we have ever spent on defence . There is an extraordinary effort in support of Ukraine , and we have highly capable armed forces who are making an extraordinary contribution to NATO , including through the latest NATO exercise , and will continue to do so . I do not want to make too much play of your earlier remarks , Madam Deputy Speaker , but I was born on the night the House was bombed and this Chamber was burned out . As I have listened to the Minister , I have been saying to myself — I hope that he will recall this — that he represents the party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher , but now that the world is more dangerous than I can recall it being in all my years , we are not able to defend the country adequately .

The first is that the right hon . Gentleman said that we had not spent that percentage since Labour were in power . Well , something extraordinary happened at the end of their time in power : they crashed the economy , we had a full - on banking crisis and a letter was left for our Government saying “ there is no money . ” It is no surprise that we had to take difficult decisions , but despite that we have shown our commitment to the armed forces . When he was Chancellor of the Exchequer , the Prime Minister approved the largest ever increase in defence spending since the cold war , and there has been further money since then in the Budget . Of course , we are committed to 2 . 5 % when the circumstances allow . For all the right hon . Gentleman ’ s bluster , he has not even committed to matching our current spending on defence , let alone 2 . 5 % ; we challenged him on that at Defence orals and he was not able to give any commitment whatever to spending . The public know where we stand : 2 . 3 % in the year ahead and 2 . 5 % when the economics allow . We do not have a clue where Labour stands . I agree with the Minister that we have extraordinarily capable armed forces whose productivity is second to none . However , as is set out in “ Ready for War ? ” , our Defence Committee report , they are extremely engaged globally and have a great deal to do , much of which is invaluable . At the same time , they are having to prepare for the “ pre - war ” phase to which the Defence Secretary referred . In that context , does my hon . Friend agree that the timing of the 2 . 5 % target — that is very welcome and a very good first step — needs to be determined by the level of threat as a priority expenditure , rather than as economic conditions allow ? I do not think that we can commit to levels of public expenditure or tax cuts , for example , without being confident that the economy can support them in a prudent fashion — an entirely reasonable and rational approach . However , I totally agree with my right hon . Friend the Chair of the Defence Committee . We all recognise that we are living in a more dangerous world — the Secretary of State has alluded to the threats we face not just in Ukraine but in respect of other adversaries around the world — and I totally understand why there is the wider debate on what we spend , but we already have a significant budget , and we must ensure that it is spent well and delivers value for money . That is why a key priority for me is reform of our procurement system so that we can ensure that our armed forces can prioritise effectively . Ultimately , it is the capability that we have now that will determine our ability to warfight . I call the SNP spokesman . I congratulate the shadow Defence Secretary on securing the urgent question and join him and the Minister in remembering those on HMS Richmond . On Friday , the Public Accounts Committee ’ s found that the “ MoD is increasingly reliant on the UK ’ s allies to protect our national interests .

Does he agree that the first thing that must be looked at is the spending of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to lease back the defence base on Diego Garcia , which we currently own ? Why is he still pursuing that deal ? Earlier today , I made a speech about the realism that should drive our foreign policy . As part of that , he must scrap his disastrous plan to surrender the Chagos islands and have British taxpayers pay for the privilege . The key difference between we Conservatives and the Labour party is that we know that we need a strong economy for defence . We need a serious plan to get the British economy growing again . We do not have that with the latest Budget from the Chancellor . Will the Prime Minister tell us whether there will be a fiscal event this spring , even though his Government are committed to only one fiscal event per year ? In summary , the Prime Minister made four points . I agree with him that NATO is a bedrock of our security , as I said this morning , and that the US is our most important bilateral relationship , but friends tell each other when they disagree . We agree on this issue ; we know that Ukraine must be supported , and I share his concern about statements that have been made about President Zelensky . I agree with him about protecting security in Europe , and I welcome his continued strengthening of alliances , but we must do that through NATO , building on the joint expeditionary force approach . Of course , we agree that we need peace , with Ukraine agreed . I do not necessarily agree with the Prime Minister ’ s change of the national security posture , because we have different views on that — I am a Conservative realist , not a progressive internationalist — but I want him to know that when he does the right thing , we will work with him in the national interest . May I first thank the Leader of the Opposition for her support in relation to today ’ s announcement and on Ukraine ? That is important to the Government , to the House and , most of all , to the Ukrainians and President Zelensky . They want to see unity in our House — they value unity in our House — as they enter , after three years of conflict , a very difficult stage in the war with Russia and against Russian aggression . I hope and believe that we can maintain that unity in relation to Ukraine , as we have done for three years . I am very proud that this House has done that , notwithstanding a change of Government , for three long years — we will continue to do so . The Leader of the Oppositions asks about the money for defence , security and intelligence . There was new money in the Budget in relation to that , but what I am doing here is in addition to the 2 . 5 % , which is the increased defence spend as it has always been understood , to recognise that the nature of the threats to our county are different now , and that the security and intelligence services play a key part for us and our allies in our defence . That takes the total to 2 . 6 % . The Leader of the Opposition asks whether we will tax or borrow to pay for the 2 . 5 % .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2025-02-25.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2025-02-25.txt"}, {"rank": 6, "score": 0.6152794361114502, "chunk_id": "debates2024-11-26_F15", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2024-11-26.txt", "date": "2024-11-26", "parliament": "UK", "text": "That is why we are working so closely with NATO and EU partners on that very issue .

I was with Tony Blinken just yesterday . Defence spending is a key aspect of our relationship with the United States . Will the Foreign Secretary be able to tell our American allies the date on which we will increase defence spending to 2 . 5 % ? If he cannot , what influence will we have on European allies to increase their defence spending ? The hon . Gentleman is right to raise the issue of defence spending . It has been raised by US Presidents since Eisenhower . He is right that when Donald Trump came to power there were just four European countries spending above 2 % . When Labour left government it was at 2 . 5 % . We are sad that it dropped and we are determined to get it back to 2 . 5 % of GDP . If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities . In the past month , growth was at the heart of my visit to Africa . We agreed work on a new global plan in South Africa and a new strategic partnership with Nigeria . During our UN Security Council presidency we have shown support for Ukraine 1 , 000 days into the war and pressed for a lasting peace in the middle east , and I condemned Russia ’ s shameful veto of a resolution on Sudan . Finally , throughout COP we have been restoring British leadership on climate . Since coming into office , the Government have suspended arms export licences to Israel ; rolled over on the International Criminal Court , with nothing new against Hamas terrorists ; and poured cash into the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , despite concerns over a significant number of its staff double - hatting with Hamas . Many of those things have been published in Arabic on the UK Government ’ s website . Who decides what should be published in Arabic ? Why are they being published in Arabic ? As they relate to Israel , why is nothing being published in Hebrew ? The art of diplomacy is speaking to foreign leaders and foreign nations as best we can in the UK ’ s national interest . That does sometimes involve foreign languages , which is why , for example , we support the BBC World Service . It was a slightly bizarre question . We can all agree that ending human trafficking across the English channel requires an approach that is co - ordinated with that of all the countries from which people are being trafficked . Can the Foreign Secretary assure the House that the French Government share our commitment to smashing the gangs and ending these crossings ? My hon .

It would re - establish our leadership in Europe . ” But there is a growing gap between the Defence Secretary ’ s rhetoric and the reality for our armed forces , who are charged with preparing for this new dangerous era . In the Budget there was no new money for defence , nothing new for Ukraine , and nothing for Gaza or the UK ’ s operations in the middle east . Worse , both the Treasury and the House of Commons Library confirm that the defence budget will be cut by £2 . 5 billion in cash terms in this next financial year . The 2 . 5 % of GDP , which the Minister referred to , was not mentioned once in the Treasury Red Book ; the last time this country spent 2 . 5 % of GDP on defence was in 2010 under a Labour Government . While Putin wages war in Europe , Ministers are warring with each other . Challenging defence policy in public , the Minister for Security was on TV this morning calling for 2 . 5 % now . That is a serious breakdown in collective ministerial responsibility , but I am most concerned about the serious state of the UK armed forces . What signal does it send to our adversaries when our forces have been hollowed out and underfunded for the last 14 years ; when the Public Accounts Committee finds the largest ever funding deficit in the MOD ’ s equipment plans ; when the British Army has been cut to its smallest size since Napoleon ; when forces recruitment targets have been missed each and every year for 14 years ; and when satisfaction with service life has hit a record low ? I have one simple question for the Minister : where is the plan for better defending Britain ? It is clear that our armed forces cannot afford another five years of a Conservative Government . I am grateful to the right hon . Gentleman for his comments about HMS Richmond . I am sure that we all agree and pay tribute to our Royal Navy personnel , who are there ultimately to defend not only themselves but freedom of navigation for the rest of the world . We should recognise the importance of the role that they are undertaking on behalf of our Government . The right hon . Gentleman talked about the funding for next year . To be clear , that will represent a 1 . 8 % increase in real terms and not the cut that he suggested . If we spend the money that we expect , it will amount to £55 . 6 billion — about 2 . 3 % of GDP , which is traditionally how we measure our spending . That is significantly above the just under 2 . 1 % in 2019 , so it is a significant increase as a percentage of GDP . The right hon . Gentleman also talked about recruitment , which is an important issue . My right hon . Friend the Minister for Defence People and Families is doing a lot of work on that and , as the right hon . Gentleman will be aware , in January we saw the highest number of applications to the Army in six years . A more positive picture is developing , recognising the importance of the mission . We should not talk down our armed forces when we expect people to apply and to want to be recruited into them . I note the range of comments about the 2 . 5 % and want to make several points . The first is that the right hon . Gentleman said that we had not spent that percentage since Labour were in power .", "file_abs_path": "C:\\Users\\ethan\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\exo3\\data\\ex2_clean\\UK\\debates2024-03-11.txt", "file_uri": "file:///C:/Users/ethan/OneDrive/Bureau/exo3/data/ex2_clean/UK/debates2024-03-11.txt"}, {"rank": 8, "score": 0.6090879440307617, "chunk_id": "debates2025-09-08_F6", "parent_id": null, "filename": "debates2025-09-08.txt", "date": "2025-09-08", "parliament": "UK", "text": "On defence spending , can the Secretary of State confirm what percentage of GDP will be used to set the cost envelope for the defence investment plan ? When we settle our defence investment plan and produce our annual report and accounts , the data that the hon . Gentleman seeks will be set out clearly and in the customary way to this House . Interestingly , the answer is not 3 . 5 % , it is not 3 % , and it is not even 2 . 6 % — those are the figures we declare to NATO ; they are not from the Ministry of Defence budget . As the then armed forces Minister , the hon . Member for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport , confirmed to me last week in a written answer , the amount we will spend on the defence investment plan comes entirely from the MOD ’ s departmental budget . Therefore , the actual figure for funding our future defence equipment is just 2 . 2 % by 2027 , with no funded plans to go any higher . Given the threats we face , is 2 . 2 % enough ? It should come as no surprise to anyone that the defence investment plan will be funded from the defence budget . That is exactly what will happen . It will be funded and supported by the record increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war — by the £5 billion extra in this year ’ s Budget — with an aim to spend 3 % of GDP on defence during the next Parliament . These are commitments that the previous Conservative Government had 14 years to make , but never made . This is a Government who are delivering for defence and delivering for Britain . Whether he plans to implement the outstanding recommendations of the second report of the Defence Committee of Session 2021 - 22 , “ Protecting those who protect us : Women in the Armed Forces from Recruitment to Civilian Life ” , HC 154 . Defence as a whole has accepted 33 recommendations from the “ Women in the Armed Forces ” report . We have two outstanding elements still in train : the results of an armed forces sexual harassment survey , and a veterans strategy with a specific female veterans section . Both will be released in the autumn . On top of this , we have a tri - service complaints system — which I personally brought in — and the violence against women and girls taskforce , to make sure that any woman can serve with safety and pride . The Atherton report , published in 2021 , surveyed 4 , 000 female service personnel and veterans . It revealed that 62 % had been victims of bullying , discrimination , harassment or sexual assault during their service . Does the Minister recognise that at a time when we are expanding our armed forces , we must improve the overall experience of women in the military , protect female personnel , and help servicewomen achieve their full potential ? I could not agree more with the hon . Member . Obviously , in our Minister for the armed forces , my hon . Friend the Member for North East Derbyshire ( Louise Sandher - Jones ) , we have an individual who has lived experience of being a female in the armed forces . It is really important to mention the individual who sits at the bottom of the command chain — where do they go if they are experiencing a problem ? Where do they seek help , and who do they complain to ?
